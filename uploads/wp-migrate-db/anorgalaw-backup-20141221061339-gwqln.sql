The fact is R.B.I. Came to existance under the hands of British and their preferables were inserted by ignoring the presence mata laxmi devi\'s photograph as the logo of R.B.I.(3) Why jawarhar lall took the oath from the hands of mount beaten instead an Indian justice? who is seen stand just back side of the oath ceremony?Jinnah did not take the oath from any britishers    neither kept any justice behind the scene.(4) Who is responsible for humiliation today faced by each and every Indian players at the fixing ground of so called olympic game?

If I treat it with care it will last me for years to come. I paired it with my Tibi red leather top. You will be seeing this top pretty often as it is so versatile. The ruched skirt in black is from T by Alexander Wang. You can adjust the length to whatever you feel comfortable with so it is a fabulous basic. These Dolce Vita jemma ankle boots are on sale right now. I snagged them for $150 and they will go with anything since they are black suede. They are also very comfortable. A draped leather jacket from Helmut Lang was all I needed to keep warm thanks to the leather tee and the leopard cashmere scarf. Blue Nile was kind enough to let me build a custom charm bracelet. I chose a nautical theme with a shell, starfish, and an oyster that opens up to reveal a pearl inside. You will have the chance to win this exact charm bracelet courtesy of Blue Nile very soon.

Discovered by <a href="http://joncave.co.uk/">Jon Cave</a>, <a href="http://www.miqrogroove.com/">Robert Chapin</a>, and <a href="https://johnblackbourn.com/">John Blackbourn</a> of the WordPress security team.</li>\n<li>A cross-site request forgery that could be used to trick a user into changing their password.</li>\n<li>An issue that could lead to a denial of service when passwords are checked. Reported by <a href="http://www.behindthefirewalls.com/">Javier Nieto Arevalo</a> and <a href="http://www.devconsole.info/">Andres Rojas Guerrero</a>.</li>\n<li>Additional protections for server-side request forgery attacks when WordPress makes HTTP requests. Reported by Ben Bidner (vortfu).</li>\n<li>An extremely unlikely hash collision could allow a user&#8217;s account to be compromised, that also required that they haven&#8217;t logged in since 2008 (I wish I were kidding). Reported by <a href="http://david.dw-perspective.org.uk">David Anderson</a>.</li>\n<li>WordPress now invalidates the links in a password reset email if the user remembers their password, logs in, and changes their email address. Reported separately by <a href="https://twitter.com/MomenBassel">Momen Bassel</a>, <a href="http://c0dehouse.blogspot.in/">Tanoy Bose</a>, and <a href="https://managewp.com/">Bojan Slavković of ManageWP</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Version 4.0.1 also fixes 23 bugs with 4.0, and we&#8217;ve made two hardening changes, including better validation of EXIF data we are extracting from uploaded photos.

At first glance, you might think the theme is rather plain. The screenshot on the theme&#8217;s description page doesn&#8217;t indicate anything interesting going on under the hood, but something about it intrigued me enough to put it up on a test site.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Nulis-screenshot.png" rel="prettyphoto[36133]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Nulis-screenshot.png?resize=880%2C660" alt="Nulis-screenshot" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-36136" /></a></p>\n<p>Nulis includes several options built into the native customizer for adding your own header image, background, a custom logo, the ability to change the header text color, and more. Once customized, the theme looks quite a bit less plain than its screenshot.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/nullis-customized.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[36133]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/nullis-customized.jpg?resize=1025%2C862" alt="nullis-customized" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-36142" /></a></p>\n<p>The icon on the top right spins when clicked and fades in a search bar. The icon at the top left of the theme also spins and opens a hidden panel with your logo, bio, navigation menu, social links, and any custom widgets you wish to add. Everything included in the hidden panel can be added via the customizer.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/nulis-hidden-panel.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[36133]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/nulis-hidden-panel.jpg?resize=1025%2C862" alt="nulis-hidden-panel" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-36147" /></a></p>\n<p>Nulis is the Javanese word for &#8216;writing,&#8217; and the theme does an excellent job of highlighting your content, especially if you are fond of post formats. Each post format has its own unique styling to set it apart from the others. The one-column theme surrounds your content with ample white space and showcases large, full-width featured images. The theme is also responsive and looks fantastic on mobile devices.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/nulis-responsive.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[36133]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/nulis-responsive.jpg?resize=1025%2C862" alt="nulis-responsive" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-36144" /></a></p>\n<p>Check out the <a href="http://nulis.esy.es/" target="_blank">live demo</a> to see the theme in action, and make sure to try the interactive icons at the top while you&#8217;re there.

Postmatic beta 6 introduced <a href="http://wptavern.com/postmatic-now-supports-1-click-migration-of-subscribers-from-jetpack" target="_blank">1-click migration of subscribers from Jetpack</a>, in order to make it easy for Jetpack users to get on board.</p>\n<p>The plugin aims to make WordPress and post/comment subscription emails work seamlessly, so that users don&#8217;t have to leave their inboxes to interact with commenters. While the base plugin is free for any number of blogs and subscribers, the Postmatic creators are looking to monetize it in the future by offering paid delivery of outgoing mail for larger sites.</p>\n<p>In an effort to compete against the Jetpack-dominated comment subscription feature, Postmatic is aggressively signing up new users via its free concierge service. For a limited time, the team will perform the following for users who wish to switch to Postmatic:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep things safe and back up your database</li>\n<li>Handle the nuts and bolts to get the plugin installed</li>\n<li>Customize your email template by creating a header image and assigning some handy widgets to your footer</li>\n<li>Migrate your existing users from Jetpack, Mailpoet, Mailchimp, Feedburner or other double-opt-in email or subscription service</li>\n<li>Invite your past commenters to join to subscribe so your content gets right into their inbox</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The free concierge service is limited to the first 50 people who respond by filling out Postmatic&#8217;s <a href="http://gopostmatic.com/concierge/" target="_blank">application</a>. If the service is successful, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see it added to the product&#8217;s commercial offerings in the near future.</p>\n<p>Comments are vital to the health of a blog and are often the strongest indicator of engagement on your content. Based on the initial response to Postmatic, WordPress users who <a href="http://wptavern.com/why-comments-still-matter" target="_blank">value comments</a> are eager to find better ways to extend them to boost interaction.</p>\n<p>Postmatic, like many other new products, is entering the marketplace with the strategy of building a strong user base around its free plugin. Its creators are aiming to capture a share of the post/comment subscription market with importers for Jetpack, Mailpoet, Mailchimp, Feedburner and other services before the official public launch.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 19 Dec 2014 22:10:15 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"WPTavern: Menu Customizer Now in Development for WordPress 4.2";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=36046";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:72:"http://wptavern.com/menu-customizer-now-in-development-for-wordpress-4-2";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3581:"<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/hammer.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[36046]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/hammer.jpg?resize=984%2C447" alt="hammer" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23557" /></a></p>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-1-dinah-released" target="_blank">WordPress 4.1</a> was released just yesterday, but core contributors are already planning and working towards 4.2. The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/menu-customizer/" target="_blank">Menu Customizer</a> feature plugin is back in development and contributors are hoping to have it ready for inclusion in 4.2. <a href="http://celloexpressions.com/" target="_blank">Nick Halsey</a>, who originally started the Menu Customizer work as part of his Google Summer of Code project, will be leading the effort to get the feature prepared for the upcoming release.</p>\n<p>During the last release cycle, Halsey was focused on improving the Customizer API in core to add dynamic and contextual controls, sections, and panels. The Menu Customizer plugin has now been updated to be compatible with WordPress 4.1 and is ready to pick up development where it left off. As it&#8217;s no longer a GSoC project, Halsey is now <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/12/19/menu-customizer-call-for-contributors/" target="_blank">actively looking for contributors</a>.</p>\n<p>Currently, the menu customizer is usable and offers the ability to assign menus to locations, edit existing menus/menu items, and add new menus.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/menu-customizer.png" rel="prettyphoto[36046]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/menu-customizer.png?resize=1025%2C570" alt="menu-customizer" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-36056" /></a></p>\n<p>Halsey outlined a roadmap for preparing the Menu Customizer for merge, which includes a number of PHP and Javascript development tasks, including, but not limited to, the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Build-out the core API for adding Customizer sections and controls entirely with JavaScript, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30741" target="_blank">#30741</a> and its related tickets (PHP, JS)</li>\n<li>Drag and Drop menu item reordering needs to do sub-menus (code imported from nav-menus.php is commented out in menu-customizer.js currently) (JS)</li>\n<li>Fix problems with previewing updates to menu items, and with previewing newly-added menus once items are added (JS)</li>\n<li>Redo the add-menu-items “panel” to lazy-load its contents &#038; utilize Backbone sub-views (PHP, JS)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>He also hopes to <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28784" target="_blank">improve the experience of using the customizer on mobile</a>, followed by getting the menu customizer plugin to work on mobile. Halsey is also looking for contributors to assist on the design, code review, a backwards-compatibility audit, and inline documentation.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious about how the Menu Customizer works, anyone is welcome to try the plugin and offer feedback. For the time being, it is compatible with WordPress 4.1 but may require 4.2-alpha down the road as it progresses.</p>\n<p>Contributor interest is critical for the Menu Customizer to have a shot at inclusion in WordPress 4.2.

This update also includes new releases with the same security fix for older Git versions.</p>\n<p>GitHub <a href="https://github.com/blog/1938-vulnerability-announced-update-your-git-clients" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that GitHub for Windows and GitHub for Mac are both affected and should be updated immediately. The GitHub engineering team explains how attackers might exploit the vulnerability:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The vulnerability concerns Git and Git-compatible clients that access Git repositories in a case-insensitive or case-normalizing filesystem. An attacker can craft a malicious Git tree that will cause Git to ovewrite its own .git/config file when cloning or checking out a repository, leading to arbitrary command execution in the client machine. Git clients running on OS X (HFS+) or any version of Microsoft Windows (NTFS, FAT) are exploitable through this vulnerability. Linux clients are not affected if they run in a case-sensitive filesystem.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using GitHub&#8217;s client for <a href="https://windows.github.com/" target="_blank">Windows</a> or <a href="https://mac.github.com/" target="_blank">Mac</a>, the security issue has been patched and is ready for download. This includes an update to both the desktop application and the bundled version of the Git command-line client. If you&#8217;re using any other kind of Git client or software that connects to Git repositories, you&#8217;ll want to update immediately.</p>\n<p>Although the issue should not affect Linux users, the release announcement encourages those who operate hosting services with users that fetch from Windows or Mac OS X machines to update in order to protect users with older versions of Git.

With no database to maintain and no comments to moderate, Jekyll radically simplifies blogging. It&#8217;s also the software that powers blogging on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a>.</p>\n<p>Moving content from WordPress to Jekyll is super easy, thanks to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jekyll-exporter/" target="_blank">Jekyll Exporter</a> plugin created by <a href="https://twitter.com/BenBalter" target="_blank">Ben Balter</a>. His Jekyll-powered blog is hosted on <a href="http://ben.balter.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, along with his <a href="https://github.com/benbalter/wordpress-to-jekyll-exporter" target="_blank">exporter plugin</a>, which has been in development for more than a year. It was recently updated to be even easier to use and is now available on WordPress.org.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p>Want to move from <a href="https://twitter.com/WordPress">@WordPress</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/jekyllrb">@jekyllrb</a>? The native, one-click exporter got a big refresh; now in plugin directory <a href="https://t.co/tUWrOe9Tn4">https://t.co/tUWrOe9Tn4</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Ben Balter (@BenBalter) <a href="https://twitter.com/BenBalter/status/543442743197179904">December 12, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>The one-click plugin converts all posts, pages, taxonomies, metadata, and settings to Markdown and YAML, which can be dropped right into Jekyll.</p>\n<h3>Who Needs a Jekyll Exporter?</h3>\n<p>I think WordPress is the best blogging software out there, but there are some bloggers who don&#8217;t want the hassle of comment moderation and all the maintenance that WordPress requires. This plugin is perfect for conveniently transitioning to Jekyll.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also useful if you have created a bunch of documentation for a project on your WordPress site but decide to move the docs to a freely hosted Jekyll-powered site on GitHub Pages. This allows you to manage your documentation with version control and makes it easy for others to contribute.</p>\n<p>I have not found Jekyll terribly easy to set up when I&#8217;ve worked with it in the past. That&#8217;s why this exporter plugin is a huge time saver &#8211; it basically does everything for you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Converts all posts, pages, and settings from WordPress for use in Jekyll</li>\n<li>Export what your users see, not what the database stores (runs post content through the_content filter prior to export, allowing third-party plugins to modify the output)</li>\n<li>Converts all post_content to Markdown Extra (using Markdownify)</li>\n<li>Converts all post_meta and fields within the wp_posts table to YAML front matter for parsing by Jekyll</li>\n<li>Generates a _config.yml with all settings in the wp_options table</li>\n<li>Outputs a single zip file with _config.yml, pages, and _posts folder containing .md files for each post in the proper Jekyll naming convention</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Jekyll Exporter plugin has no settings to configure. Just click the button and you&#8217;ll have all your content exported into the correct format for Jekyll and organized into the right structure.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re having trouble with your server timing out on the export, Balter has ensured that the plugin is compatible with WP-CLI. You can run this command, which also has support for sites where wp-content isn&#8217;t in the traditional location:</p>\n<p><code>wp jekyll-export &gt; export.zip</code></p>\n<p>Currently, the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jekyll-exporter/" target="_blank">Jekyll Exporter</a> is the only one of its kind in the WordPress.org plugin directory. Fortunately, it was created by a reputable developer who knows the ins and outs of using Jekyll after WordPress.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 18 Dec 2014 21:33:53 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:39:"Post Status: WordPress 4.1, “Dinah”";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"http://www.poststat.us/?p=7245";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"http://www.poststat.us/wordpress-4-1-dinah/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7656:"<p><img src="http://www.poststat.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/wordpress-4-1-752x300.jpg" alt="wordpress-4-1" width="627" height="250" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7247" /><br />\nWordPress 4.1, &#8220;Dinah&#8221;, <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2014/12/dinah/">has just been released</a>. WordPress 4.1 is the result of months of work and includes a number of excellent new features.</p>\n<p>WordPress 4.1 was led by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/johnbillion">John Blackbourn</a>, who did an outstanding job. Two hundred and eighty three contributors were part of WordPress 4.1, which Matt Mullenweg states is a new high.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the new features.</p>\n<h3>Persistent Distraction-free Writing</h3>\n<p>I must begin with the new persistent Distraction-free Writing feature, as I&#8217;m using it to write this very post. We&#8217;ve had Distraction-free Writing since 2011, with the <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2011/07/gershwin/">release of WordPress 3.2</a>. However, it&#8217;s always been a single-experience decision. You hit the button to enter distraction free mode, and you utilize it for a single writing session.<span id="more-7245"></span></p>\n<p>Now, the button itself is persistent, and the experience of writing distraction free doesn&#8217;t enter a new screen, but rather fade away the distractions of the default editor.</p>\n<p><a href="https://cloudup.com/cqbFU6CSqm2"><img src="https://cldup.com/Gya2WLi5yP-900x900.png" alt="Screen Shot" width="900" height="585" /></a></p>\n<p>The left admin seamlessly floats away, as do the metaboxes to the right of and below the editor. The editor itself remains, versus using a modified editor like before.</p>\n<p>When you update to WordPress 4.1, you are triggered with a note about Distraction-free Writing, and now that it&#8217;s a decision you only have to make once, I think this feature will finally get the broad use it deserves. It really is much more pleasant to write without everything else around you, to be lost in your thoughts as they make their way to the editor.</p>\n<h3>Twenty Fifteen theme</h3>\n<p><a href="https://cloudup.com/cgjoFpPJvYk"><img src="https://cldup.com/RA_QnzIQ8P-2000x2000.png" alt="Screen Shot" width="877" height="651" /></a></p>\n<p>The Twenty Fifteen theme is the finest work I&#8217;ve seen yet of the default theme team. A blogging, and personal, theme &#8212; Twenty Fifteen is simple, with beautiful typography, and capable of showcasing blog posts of any format with poise.</p>\n<p>Twenty Fifteen comes in six base color schemes: default (light), dark, yellow, ping, purple, and blue. It also supports WordPress&#8217; background and header image features, and allows you to customize colors from your base selection; Twenty Fifteen can be as quirky as you are.</p>\n<p><a href="https://cloudup.com/cFEI4yyaDmU"><img src="https://cldup.com/fRQdHcxeXD-900x900.png" alt="Screen Shot" width="900" height="555" /></a></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a link to the <a href="http://twentyfifteendemo.wordpress.com/">default theme demo</a>, as well as it&#8217;s <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyfifteen">new page on WordPress.org</a>.</p>\n<h3>Dozens of languages, available any time</h3>\n<p><a href="https://cloudup.com/ckbOnTY71Gq"><img src="https://cldup.com/UqYmETHq8L-900x900.png" alt="Screen Shot" width="901" height="733" /></a></p>\n<p>WordPress has made tremendous progress for non-English speaking users in the past few releases. With WordPress 4.0, you could choose a language on installation, whereas before it required many more steps. Now the team has gone a step further, so that language can be changed at any time, right from WordPress&#8217; general settings page.</p>\n<p>Given that <a href="http://www.poststat.us/understand-wordpress-internationalization-translation/">a third of WordPress installs are non-English</a> (and if I recall correctly half of new downloads are non-English now), this change further reduces the barrier of language in publishing software, and is an excellent move for the progression of the platform across the world.</p>\n<h3>Recommended plugins</h3>\n<p><a href="https://cloudup.com/cQi9LX744H8"><img src="https://cldup.com/r3jaQ2VeCP-900x900.png" alt="Screen Shot" width="900" height="674" /></a></p>\n<p>I believe recommended plugins is probably the most controversial feature in WordPress 4.1, though it is not without precedent. &#8220;Featured&#8221; themes have been in the WordPress dashboard for a while now. But with a tab for recommended plugins, now users can see plugin recommendations based on plugins already installed and plugins other sites have installed.</p>\n<p>Recommended plugins are replacing the former popular plugins tab, and is mostly a change in the underlying API for showing the plugins themselves. Since it&#8217;s not a manual recommendation, I think this is a good change, and will more accurately help folks find relevant plugins than just listing the most popular plugins in the directory.</p>\n<h3>New template tags and theming tools</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m really looking forward to using some of the new template tags introduced in WordPress 4.1.</p>\n<p>My favorite is <code>get_the_archive_title()</code>. Themers out there all know about the big blob of conditionals in most theme archive templates to spit out the right string based on which archive template it is. Now, there&#8217;s a function for that, and it&#8217;s fully filterable to boot.</p>\n<p>Descriptions of the new title functions, some new pagination functions, and some particularly nice body class assignment enhancements are well described on <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/12/04/new-template-tags-in-4-1/">this Make WordPress post</a> by Konstantin Obenland. There&#8217;s also a post about adding theme support to <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/10/29/title-tags-in-4-1/">let WordPress handle title tags</a>, which is a handy thing.</p>\n<h3>Log out from anywhere</h3>\n<p>A relatively small but nice security feature is the new ability to log out of all installs from a single location. WordPress uses cookies to keep you logged into your install for a period of time. Well, if you ever leave yourself logged in on a computer you don&#8217;t trust, you can now log out of all instances easily, from your profile page on an install.</p>\n<p>There is a new button that says &#8220;Log Out of All Other Sessions,&#8221; and also tells you if you are logged in at more than one location.</p>\n<h3>More improvements to queries</h3>\n<p>I love how much progress has been made on the WordPress query tools in the last couple of years. WordPress 4.1 introduces the ability for a nested query syntax, which makes more complex queries possible for <code>WP_Tax_Query</code>, <code>WP_Date_Query</code>, and <code>WP_Meta_Query</code>. I don&#8217;t often call out single individual&#8217;s work on something, but Boone Georges <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/29822">really</a> <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/29738">slayed</a> <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/29642">it</a> with the nested queries work. He wrote about it <a href="http://teleogistic.net/2014/12/wordpress-4-1-and-me/">on his blog in detail</a>.</p>\n<h3>More under the hood</h3>\n<p>WordPress 4.1 includes many other under the hood features you should check out on the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.1">Codex page about the release</a>.</p>\n<h3>More excellent progress for WordPress</h3>\n<p>WordPress is better than ever, and hundreds (or thousands) of people make it so. Great job everyone. Now, go download WordPress 4.1.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 18 Dec 2014 19:12:52 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"WPTavern: WordPress 4.1 “Dinah” Released";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=35700";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-1-dinah-released";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7758:"<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/dinah.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[35700]"><img class="size-full wp-image-35977" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/dinah.jpg?resize=1025%2C502" alt="photo credit: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Image" /></a>photo credit: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Image\n<p>After nearly four months of development, WordPress 4.1 &#8220;Dinah&#8221; in honor of jazz singer <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinah_Washington">Dinah Washington</a>, is <a title="https://wordpress.org/news/2014/12/wordpress-4-1-dinah/" href="https://wordpress.org/news/2014/12/wordpress-4-1-dinah/">available for download</a>.

It also ships with five different color schemes, ranging from dark to pink that are accessible from within the theme customizer.</p>\n<h2>Plugin Recommendations</h2>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/RecommendedPluginsTab.png" rel="prettyphoto[35700]"><img class="size-full wp-image-35318" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/RecommendedPluginsTab.png?resize=1025%2C527" alt="Plugins Recommended To Me Based on Data of Sites with Similar Plugins Installed" /></a>Plugins Recommended To Me Based on Data of Sites with Similar Plugins Installed\n<p>When you browse to the Add New plugins screen, you&#8217;ll see a new Recommended tab. Recommendations are based on data from thousands of WordPress sites about plugins that are commonly used together. It&#8217;s similar to an online store&#8217;s &#8220;people who bought this also bought this&#8221; feature.  Because of the strict data set used, plugins that are 3-4 years old or older won&#8217;t be recommended.</p>\n<h2>Improved Distraction Free Writing</h2>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/DistractionFreeWriting41.png" rel="prettyphoto[35700]"><img class="size-full wp-image-35707" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/DistractionFreeWriting41.png?resize=1025%2C501" alt="Distraction Free Writing in WordPress 4.1" /></a>Distraction Free Writing in WordPress 4.1\n<p>When you enable Distraction Free Writing mode, the surrounding interface disappears as you type leaving important actions and menu items just a mouse movement away. This mode minimizes distractions without having to go through a clunky transition to access the admin menu or meta boxes. To bring back the menu and meta boxes, move the mouse cursor to the left or right of the editor.</p>\n<h2>Log Out of Every Session With One Button</h2>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/WordPressSessionUI.png" rel="prettyphoto[35700]"><img class="size-full wp-image-35708" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/WordPressSessionUI.png?resize=982%2C357" alt="WordPress Session UI" /></a>WordPress Session UI\n<p>WordPress 4.1 includes a new Session UI. The UI shows up on the profile page when WordPress detects more than one active session. When pressed, the button logs out of every session except for the active one. This is useful for those times when users might have forgotten to log off from a laptop, phone, or public computer.</p>\n<h2>Inline Image Editing</h2>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/InlineImageEditing.png" rel="prettyphoto[35700]"><img class="size-full wp-image-35709" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/InlineImageEditing.png?resize=681%2C386" alt="Inline Image Editing Tools" /></a>Inline Image Editing Tools\n<p>When editing an image using the Visual editor, a set of inline editing tools appear above the image. These tools provide a quick and easy way to align an image or access additional editing options.</p>\n<h2>oEmbed Support Added For Vine</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.1 has<a title="http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds"> oEmbed support</a> for <a title="https://vine.co" href="https://vine.co">Vine</a> which hosts short videos that continuously loop. Sharing a Vine is now as easy as copying and pasting the URL into the Visual editor.</p>\n<h2>Choose a Different Language at Any Time</h2>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/SiteLanguageWordPress4.1.png" rel="prettyphoto[35700]"><img class="size-full wp-image-35711" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/SiteLanguageWordPress4.1.png?resize=637%2C450" alt="Site Language Picker in WordPress 4.1" /></a>Site Language Picker in WordPress 4.1\n<p>You can now choose a language for your site at any time by visiting the General Settings screen. Choosing a different language installs the required <a title="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_in_Your_Language" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_in_Your_Language">language pack</a>.</p>\n<h2>Developer Items</h2>\n<p>Metadata, date, and term queries now support <a title="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/10/20/update-on-query-improvements-in-4-1/" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/10/20/update-on-query-improvements-in-4-1/">advanced conditional logic</a>, like nested clauses and multiple operators. There are a couple of <a title="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/12/04/new-template-tags-in-4-1/" href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/12/04/new-template-tags-in-4-1/">new Template tags</a> and a major improvement with <a title="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-1-to-introduce-theme-support-for-the-title-tag" href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-1-to-introduce-theme-support-for-the-title-tag">Title Tags</a> in 4.1. There have also been several <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/10/27/toward-a-complete-javascript-api-for-the-customizer/">improvements to the Customizer API</a>, including contextual panels, sections, and JavaScript templates for controls.</p>\n<h2>4.1 Represents Continued Improvement</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.1 is the product of dedicated developers and 283 contributors. The ability to choose a language without having to touch a line of code is a great improvement. The default theme is refreshing compared to Twenty Fourteen and users have an entire year to manipulate the design. While some users will see the new Distraction Free Writing mode as a distraction, others will enjoy its convenience.</p>\n<p>This is one of the first major WordPress releases in a long time that doesn&#8217;t have a video walk through. To take its place, here is a video featuring songs from Dinah Washington in 1954.</p>\n<p><span class="embed-youtube"></span></p>\n<p>What do you think of the new default theme and will you try out the new Distraction Free Writing mode?

The pulse is around 98 Bytes in size, but it can cause performance issues in certain situations.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve been notified by your webhost that your account is using too many resources and cite <code>POST /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php</code> as the cause, it&#8217;s likely due to the Heartbeat API.</p>\n<h2>How The Heartbeat API Works</h2>\n<p>Inmotion Hosting has an <a title="http://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/website/wordpress/heartbeat-ajax-php-usage#heartbeat-in-action" href="http://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/website/wordpress/heartbeat-ajax-php-usage#heartbeat-in-action">excellent article</a> that explains how the Heartbeat API works. If you monitor server requests while in the post editor, you&#8217;ll see <code>POST /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php "http://example.com/wp-admin/index.php</code> appear every 15 seconds. This is the pulse generated by the API.</p>\n<p>The pulse makes sure you have a persistent connection to the web server and provides a way for developers to trigger events. For example, if the pulse takes 30 seconds or longer to process, WordPress displays a connection error and attempts to reconnect to the server.</p>\n<h2>The Problem</h2>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/PulseExecutionTime.png" rel="prettyphoto[35865]"><img class="size-full wp-image-35883" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/PulseExecutionTime.png?resize=221%2C183" alt="Execution Time" /></a>Execution Time\n<p>There are several situations in which a pulse is generated either automatically, or by a user. Most of the time pulses are harmless and don&#8217;t do anything.</p>\n<p>Each pulse (POST request) executes a PHP script equating to CPU time on the server. In an experiment, InMotion Hosting left the dashboard open for a half hour and noticed <strong>25</strong> PHP script executions that used <strong>5.77</strong> CPU seconds. The small amount of CPU time was used to do nothing.</p>\n<p>The problem is compounded by the fact that each user who has access to the backend of WordPress generates a pulse. As the number of users navigating the WordPress backend simultaneously increases, so does the number of pulses generated from the API.</p>\n<p>If a webhosting provider has strict limits on the number of processes or resources used, you could easily go over the limit.</p>\n<h2>How to Control The Heartbeat API</h2>\n<p><a title="https://wordpress.org/plugins/heartbeat-control/" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/heartbeat-control/">Heartbeat Control</a>, developed by <a title="http://jeffmatson.net/" href="http://jeffmatson.net/">Jeff Matson</a>, is a new plugin that enables you to control the interval of pulses. After activating the plugin, you&#8217;ll find the settings located in <strong>Tools&gt;Heartbeat Control</strong>.</p>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/HeartbeatControlSettings.png" rel="prettyphoto[35865]"><img class="wp-image-35885 size-full" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/HeartbeatControlSettings.png?resize=502%2C258" alt="Heartbeat Control Settings" /></a>Heartbeat Control Settings\n<p>You can choose to disable the API entirely, only on the dashboard page, or allow it only on the post editing screen. You can also choose the interval when pulses are sent. The choices range from 15-60 seconds with 5 second intervals in between.</p>\n<p>By changing the interval to 60 seconds, pulses are less likely to impact server performance. Several <a title="http://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/website/wordpress/heartbeat-ajax-php-usage#comments" href="http://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/website/wordpress/heartbeat-ajax-php-usage#comments">HostGator customers</a> who use the plugin report they no longer experience suspensions for using too many resources.</p>\n<h2>Why InMotion Hosting Doesn&#8217;t Throttle The API by Default</h2>\n<p>If increasing the pulse interval from 15 to 60 seconds increases server performance, why doesn&#8217;t InMotion Hosting throttle the API on every webhosting server?</p>\n<p>Matson, who works for InMotion Hosting, says a one size fits all approach doesn&#8217;t work. &#8220;The reason we don&#8217;t do that is because there are some users that require it at the default rate or an even higher frequency. When making server-wide changes, you have to be extremely careful that you do not impact a customer&#8217;s site.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Matson goes on to say that, &#8220;As a host, the number one goal is making customers happy and restricting the normal operation of a user&#8217;s site is unacceptable.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>How HostGator Almost Deleted WP Tavern</h2>\n<p>I sympathize with those who use HostGator as they have a strict <a title="http://support.hostgator.com/articles/pre-sales-policies/rules-terms-of-service/cpu-resource-restriction" href="http://support.hostgator.com/articles/pre-sales-policies/rules-terms-of-service/cpu-resource-restriction">CPU resource restriction</a>. If pulses from the Heartbeat API cause the CPU to become busy or cause a backup in processes, using 25% of the CPU longer than 90 seconds is easy to do.</p>\n<p>HostGator&#8217;s policy for using too many resources is to suspend the account. This makes it impossible to troubleshoot the problem. If you exceed the resource allotment more than five times, the site is removed from the server and your account is banned.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/HostGatorResourcePolicy.png" rel="prettyphoto[35865]"><img class="size-full wp-image-35886" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/HostGatorResourcePolicy.png?resize=503%2C107" alt="HostGator Resource Policy" /></a>HostGator Resource Policy\n<p>In late 2013, when WP Tavern used HostGator, I experienced first-hand what it&#8217;s like to have a website suspended. When I upgraded the Tavern to WordPress 3.6, which introduced the Heartbeat API, I <a title="http://wptavern.com/my-wordpress-is-denying-itself-service" href="http://wptavern.com/my-wordpress-is-denying-itself-service">started to experience problems</a>. The site would routinely lock up and when I viewed the processes tab in cPanel, it looked like a simple process repeated itself, leading to a denial of service.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/siteoffline.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[35865]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7554" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/siteoffline.jpg?resize=741%2C644" alt="Site Offline Errors" /></a>I can&#8217;t confirm if the Heartbeat API was the culprit but it&#8217;s high on my list of suspicions. After suspending the Tavern twice, HostGator informed me that if the site was suspended again, it would be removed from the server without giving me a chance to back it up. Needless to say, I switched hosts immediately.</p>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t End Up in a Similar Situation</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using a webhosting service with strict resource limits, consider installing Heartbeat Control to limit the number of pulses. Not only will it mean fewer calls to the server, but it may lead to a performance increase as well. Keep a close eye on the resources used and if you come close to maxing out, it&#8217;s a sign you need to upgrade to a better plan. Don&#8217;t end up in a position where you may lose your site!</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 18 Dec 2014 02:19:22 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:84:"WPTavern: Atlanta WordPress Coders Guild: A New Meetup for Designers and Programmers";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=35847";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"http://wptavern.com/atlanta-wordpress-coders-guild-a-new-meetup-for-designers-and-programmers";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7495:"<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/atlanta.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[35847]"><img class="size-full wp-image-35874" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/atlanta.jpg?resize=1022%2C496" alt="photo credit: FrenchKheldar - cc" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/frenchkheldar/3322197028/">FrenchKheldar</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/">cc</a>\n<p>The Atlanta metro area will soon be getting a new type of WordPress meetup, targeted towards programmers and designers.

The organizers plan to host workshops centered around best practices expected by clients who spend $100k+ on projects that demand a high level of performance and security.</p>\n<h3>Atlanta&#8217;s Fragmented WordPress Community</h3>\n<p>Schinkel has lived in the Atlanta area for several decades and has a great deal of experience <a href="http://mikeschinkel.com/blog/25-best-practices-for-meetup-organizers/" target="_blank">organizing professional meetups</a>. He&#8217;s an accidental connector who became acquainted with many people in the area and has a unique perspective on the Atlanta tech and WordPress communities.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have a really strong tech community backed by education like Georgia Tech and ~10 Fortune 500 companies in the Atlanta area, and tons on technology meetups,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Lots of Java, .NET, Ruby, Javascript and PHP, and at least 10 large digital agencies with probably up to 1000 agencies if you count the small ones.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The startup community is also thriving in the area and Atlanta is experiencing growth across various sectors, including financial, health tech, IT security, and more. Unfortunately, this has not directly translated into a strong WordPress community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The WordPress community, however, is fragmented because of metro Atlanta’s expansive geography, lack of any natural geographic boundaries and no single entity with the clout to really organize a cohesive community,&#8221; Schinkel explained. The area has 10 different meetups, many of which fail to attract more than a handful of members on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/wordpress-atlanta/" target="_blank">Atlanta WordPress Users Group</a>, organized by Judi Knight, is the most successful with approximately 1600 members, but Schinkel says those are primarily people willing to travel to a meetup in town. Outer metro Atlanta residents are reluctant to attend.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Also, from the perspective of a professional WordPress PHP, MySQL and jQuery coder, those meetups are characterized by really novice end-users,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Rarely, if ever, is there any significant WordPress coding talent in attendance, and intermediate to advanced topics are never announced or covered.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>The Need for More Workshops Focused on Advanced Topics</h3>\n<p>Schinkel believes that the Atlanta WordPress community needs the opportunity to have more advanced workshops and developer-focused meetups. &#8220;As far as I can tell the existing successful WordPress meetups all focus on the needs of end-users,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That’s great, it is what in part has driven the success of WordPress, but it also means that there are no local meetups to help WordPress coders to grow their skills.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Schinkel used the term &#8220;coder&#8221; in the meetup name specifically to filter out those he would classify as developers.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Many people think of themselves as &#8216;WordPress Developers&#8217; when what they do is install WordPress; select, install and configure a theme; select, install and configure plugins; maybe tweak CSS; and add some page templates with a bit if loop and template tag coding. So we think of those people as &#8216;Site Builders&#8217; and think the term &#8216;developer&#8217; is too broadly adopted to have any communicable distinction in the context of WordPress people.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There are a myriad of meetups in Atlanta for WordPress end users who want to learn about using themes and plugins, but virtually no meetups for coders who want to expand their skills. This is why the organizers are spearheading a WordPress coders guild in Atlanta.</p>\n<p>&#8220;First and foremost we want to see more Atlanta agencies and internal teams in the larger Atlanta organizations choosing WordPress for their projects,&#8221; Schinkel said. &#8220;For that to happen there has to be a stronger talent base in Atlanta who are knowledgeable and experienced in WordPress best practices, at least as far as they relate to agency use of WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He anticipates that the group will probably have its first &#8220;get to know each other&#8221; meetup in January and then start workshops in February. With advanced topics in the spotlight every week, Schinkel hopes that agencies and internal teams that rarely come out to network will be more motivated to attend.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We want to create a stronger WP coder community than we currently have in Atlanta, and the one we currently have is really lacking,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Put it another way, Drupal has a far stronger developer community in Atlanta because of their Drupal meetup and yet Drupal has ~1/10th the marketshare of WordPress. Now that is really sad, don’t you think?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Schinkel and Wood have identified a common problem with many community meetups where the topics focus on end user education. While connecting with people of all skill levels is important, more advanced WordPress professionals often become less motivated to attend meetups that don&#8217;t include topics that challenge them and help them become better at their work. The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/atlanta-wordpress-coders-guild/" target="_blank">Atlanta WordPress Coders Guild</a> aims to solve this problem with an alternative, non-traditional WordPress meetup.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 17 Dec 2014 23:34:20 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:97:"WPTavern: VVV-Dashboard Provides an Interface for Managing Varying Vagrant Vagrants Installations";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=35807";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:107:"http://wptavern.com/vvv-dashboard-provides-an-interface-for-managing-varying-vagrant-vagrants-installations";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3392:"<p><a href="https://github.com/leogopal/VVV-Dashboard" target="_blank">VVV-Dashboard</a> is a new tool that provides an interface for managing your <a href="https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV" target="_blank">Varying Vagrant Vagrants</a> installations. Inspired by <a href="http://wptavern.com/variable-vvv-a-new-vvv-site-creation-wizard-for-wordpress" target="_blank">Variable VVV</a>, a script that makes it easy to create and delete sites, <a href="https://twitter.com/leogopal" target="_blank">Leo Gopal</a> made VVV-Dashboard to complement it.</p>\n<p>Gopal is a WordPress developer from Cape Town, South Africa. &#8220;I installed my first WordPress site seven years ago while in high school and started creating sites for clients ever since. Only recently, after Matt&#8217;s <a href="http://ma.tt/2014/09/five-for-the-future/" target="_blank">Five for the Future</a> speech, did I decide to come out and offer what I have to everyone, more freely,&#8221; he said. VVV-Dashboard is one of his first public contributions.</p>\n<p>The tool was designed to work with Variable VVV but can be used without it. &#8220;Because VVV is very terminal oriented, it&#8217;s easy to forget commands when you need them. For example, you might forget to &#8216;vagrant up &#8211;provision&#8217; when working with Variable VVV (and other site creators),&#8221; Gopal said. VVV-Dashboard adds a quick reference page inside your vvv.dev site for commands and includes a list of all your Vagrant installs.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/vvv-dashboard.png" rel="prettyphoto[35807]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/vvv-dashboard.png?resize=1025%2C472" alt="vvv-dashboard" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35817" /></a></p>\n<p>The title of the page displays how many VVV sites you have installed on your machine. Each site and its admin are linked, along with a <a href="http://www.xdebug.org/docs/profiler" target="_blank">profiler</a> button that offers a quick overview. In order for the profiler to work, you must have Xdebug turned on.</p>\n<p>Many developers end up with a long list of dev sites, and it can be difficult to remember what sites are active and where they are located. The VVV-Dashboard interface saves you time with a convenient list and might even inspire you to perform a cleanup of sites no longer in use.</p>\n<p>In the next few releases, Gopal plans to include more basic site info in the dashboard, such as whether or not WP_Debug is enabled, an indicator for if Xdebug is on/off, the current active theme, etc. Variable VVV recently added a blueprints feature, which allows you to set up different plugins, themes, mu-plugins, options, or constants that will be installed to a new site you create. Gopal plans to create a few blueprint examples and add them to VVV-Dashboard.</p>\n<p>VVV-Dashboard is licensed under the GPL V2. It adds a friendly layer between you and your VVV sites to make management more convenient and efficient.

Users can browse the directory for newest, recently updated, most popular, and highest rated plugins. With the exception of the <a title="https://wordpress.org/plugins/browse/updated/" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/browse/updated/">recently updated</a> category, there&#8217;s no way to discover plugins in the middle of the pack. A new <a title="https://managewp.org/plugins/best" href="https://managewp.org/plugins/best">plugin discovery tool</a> by ManageWP, attempts to solve the problem.</p>\n<h2>Algorithm Based</h2>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ManageWPBestNewPlugins.png" rel="prettyphoto[35747]"><img class="size-full wp-image-35794" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ManageWPBestNewPlugins.png?resize=925%2C663" alt="Best New Plugins" /></a>Best New Plugins Page\n<p>The front page of <a title="https://managewp.org/plugins/best" href="https://managewp.org/plugins/best">ManageWP.org/plugins</a> displays the best new plugins under 100k downloads. The plugins are determined using an algorithm that takes into account plugin quality and acceleration of growth. A plugin&#8217;s quality is determined using seven metrics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Last Updated</li>\n<li>WordPress Compatibility</li>\n<li>Support</li>\n<li>Rating</li>\n<li>Plugin Popularity</li>\n<li>Author Popularity</li>\n<li>Other plugins from the same author</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using a combination of metrics, ManageWP is able to display a constantly evolving list of <a title="https://managewp.org/plugins/rising" href="https://managewp.org/plugins/rising"><em>rising stars</em></a>. Placing emphasis on a plugin&#8217;s compatibility with WordPress and when it was last updated might motivate plugin authors to keep these fields updated.</p>\n<h2>Comparing Plugins</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious to see how plugins compare to each other, check out the <a title="https://managewp.org/#comparePlugins" href="https://managewp.org/#comparePlugins">plugin comparison section</a> of the site. Simply choose two different plugins and hit the compare button. The comparison displays each plugin&#8217;s statistics with a download chart at the bottom. At the moment, you&#8217;re limited to comparing only two plugins at the same time, but there are plans to allow for more in the future.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ManageWPPluginComparison.png" rel="prettyphoto[35747]"><img class="size-full wp-image-35793" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ManageWPPluginComparison.png?resize=915%2C493" alt="Plugin Comparisons" /></a>Plugin Comparisons\n<h2>Plugin Awards</h2>\n<p>Awards are a quick way to determine how well a plugin is doing in specific categories. For example, <a title="https://managewp.org/plugins/details/wordpress-seo" href="https://managewp.org/plugins/details/wordpress-seo">WordPress SEO</a> by Team Yoast, has a number of awards for being the most downloaded and highest rated in multiple categories. I think it would be beneficial if this area was extended to highlight more ranks like top ten, top five, and number one.</p>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/PluginAwards.png" rel="prettyphoto[35747]"><img class="size-full wp-image-35797" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/PluginAwards.png?resize=599%2C559" alt="ManageWP Plugin Awards" /></a>ManageWP Plugin Awards\n<h2>Future Improvements</h2>\n<p>ManageWP founder, Vladimir Prelovac, says he&#8217;s not finished with the site. In <a title="https://managewp.com/blog" href="https://managewp.com/blog">the announcement</a>, he shares a couple of ideas on what he&#8217;d like to see in the next iteration.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Simpler plugin comparison, allow multiple plugins compared at once.</li>\n<li>Include <a href="https://wpvulndb.com/">WP Vulnerability Database</a> security data to plugin details page and Plugin Quality score.</li>\n<li>Allow plugin authors to ‘claim’ their pages. This will allow all sorts of activity like adding the links to their premium support, answering Q&amp;A</li>\n<li>Open everything via an API so everyone can use the engine and its data</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The WP Vulnerability Database will be a nice enhancement, especially if you can see how many vulnerability reports a plugin has. Something to keep in mind is that ManageWP/Plugins is utilizing the <a title="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress.org_API" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress.org_API">WordPress.org Plugins API,</a> which limits the types of data it&#8217;s able to work with.</p>\n<h2>A Plugin Directory Without The Plugins</h2>\n<p>I love the idea behind <a title="https://managewp.org/plugins" href="https://managewp.org/plugins">ManageWP/Plugins</a> because it fills a void created by the plugin directory. It&#8217;s essentially a sub-section of the directory without the plugins. When I look for plugins to review, the directory leaves me little choice between one that&#8217;s popular or brand new. ManageWP/Plugins gives me an opportunity to discover them before they reach global popularity.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 17 Dec 2014 05:58:57 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:108:"WPTavern: WordPress Accessibility Team Is Mobilizing to Make Accessibility Required for WordPress.org Themes";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=35570";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:118:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-accessibility-team-is-mobilizing-to-make-accessibility-required-for-wordpress-org-themes";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4368:"<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/guided-road.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[35570]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22575" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/guided-road.jpg?resize=900%2C421" alt="guided-road" /></a></p>\n<p>Throughout the first half of this month, the WordPress Accessibility team has been working together with the Theme Review Team to discuss the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/2014/12/04/theme-accessibility-meeting-notes/" target="_blank">possibility of requiring the accessibility-ready tag</a> for themes hosted on WordPress.org. The team will need to create an official proposal to submit to the Theme Review Team in order to make this happen.</p>\n<p>In preparation, the Accessibility team is increasing efforts to educate theme authors on accessibility best practices. Joe Dolson published a post with <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2014/12/15/three-easy-tips-for-accessible-theming/" target="_blank">tips for making WordPress themes accessible</a>, which includes basic instructions for making themes work with a keyboard, creating event triggers as accessible controls, and adding supporting text for images.</p>\n<p>The Accessibility team also created a <a href="https://github.com/wpaccessibility/" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> for sharing WordPress-specific code examples for accessibility and plans to add resources in the near future. The theme handbook and reviewer&#8217;s handbook will potentially need to be reworked in order to account for the new guidelines. &#8220;The goal is for those documents to explicitly correlate to the theme accessibility guidelines, so that theme authors have specific guidance on what to do to meet those requirements,&#8221; Dolson said at a recent meeting.</p>\n<p>The Accessibility team hopes to announcing new guidelines for theme developers in April 2015, which would then be required as of November 2015. Once the guidelines are finalized for both required and recommended items, the Accessibility team will also need to train the Theme Review Team on reviewing for accessibility.</p>\n<p>For most traditional WordPress sites, the active theme is the face of the website, and accessibility-ready themes undoubtedly improve the experience of WordPress for users with disabilities. However, making accessibility required for themes is a long and difficult path. The possibility of the requirement already has opposition among Theme Review Team administrators.</p>\n<p>When we <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-themes-directory-now-requires-all-themes-to-be-translation-ready" target="_blank">published</a> about WordPress.org&#8217;s newest requirement for themes to be translation-ready, several readers chimed in on the comments to advocate for accessibility to be required. Justin Tadlock, a TRT admin, <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-themes-directory-now-requires-all-themes-to-be-translation-ready#comment-61697" target="_blank">replied</a>, &#8220;As an admin of TRT, full compliance with our current accessibility guidelines is something I’d fight to not make a requirement.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, making a theme accessible can sometimes mean not respecting a designer’s artistic vision. This is particularly an issue with color contrasts. Anything that would hinder design decisions like this is not something I would support. That’s beyond the scope of what TRT’s role is.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Even with more education for theme authors, additional guidelines pose another hurdle to overcome in the rigorous review process. Tadlock believes it would stifle submissions from new theme authors. &#8220;Requiring accessibility-ready themes would be such a huge barrier to entry for new theme authors that it would be detrimental to the system.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The Accessibility team is highly motivated to push for this new requirement and is currently working on a precise proposal that will be voted on by the Theme Review Team. &#8220;The important thing with the proposal is clarity,&#8221; Dolson said, recognizing that it could be blocked if the two teams are unable to communicate effectively about the issues at stake. The decisions made in the first part of 2015 will determine the immediate future of theme accessibility in the WordPress.org Themes Directory.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 16 Dec 2014 21:24:20 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:38:"Post Status: Let’s WordSesh together";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:30:"http://www.poststat.us/?p=7232";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"http://www.poststat.us/lets-wordsesh-together/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1513:"<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7233" src="http://www.poststat.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/wordsesh-3-752x317.png" alt="wordsesh-3" width="627" height="264" /></p>\n<p>This weekend, <a href="http://wordsesh.org/">WordSesh</a> 3 will begin.

This campaign has resulted in more than 11,000 domains being blacklisted by Google.</p>\n<p>SoakSoak modifies the wp-includes/template-loader.php file in order to inject Javascript, which contains the malware, into every page on compromised sites. You can check to see if your site is affected by using Sucuri&#8217;s free <a href="http://sitecheck.sucuri.net/" target="_blank">SiteCheck scanner</a>.</p>\n<p>After researching the compromised sites, Sucuri found that SoakSoak&#8217;s vehicle of attack is the <a href="http://wptavern.com/critical-security-vulnerability-found-in-wordpress-slider-revolution-plugin-immediate-update-advised" target="_blank">critical security vulnerability that was discovered in the Slider Revolution plugin</a> and made public in September. At that time, Envato identified more than <a href="http://wptavern.com/1000-wordpress-themes-on-envato-market-potentially-affected-by-revolution-slider-security-vulnerability" target="_blank">1,000 themes sold through its marketplace that were potentially affected</a> by this particular vulnerability.</p>\n<p>The Slider Revolution issue, though silently patched in February, has been actively exploited since its disclosure. Many WordPress site administrators have not updated their copies of the Slider Revolution plugin to the patched version, leaving their sites open to compromise. Since the plugin is packaged with many themes sold through Themeforest, site owners are not always aware that they are vulnerable.</p>\n<p>According to the report from Sucuri, the SoakSoak attack first scans sites to locate the vulnerable file within the Slider Revolution plugin in order to gain access to the wp-config.php file. If successful, the intruder then attempts to upload a malicious theme to the site, followed by injecting the <a href="http://labs.sucuri.net/db/malware/backdoor-phpfilesman02" target="_blank">Filesman backdoor</a> into the website. The attacker then injects another backdoor in order to modify the swfobject.js file to inject malware that redirects visitors to soaksoak.ru.</p>\n<p>This malware attack is particularly difficult to clean up after. If your site has been compromised, you cannot simply remove the infected files. The backdoors will also need to be addressed, as well as the Slider Revolution vulnerabilities. Sucuri advises stopping malicious attacks through a firewall. If your site or one of your clients&#8217; sites is using the Slider Revolution plugin, it is imperative that you check to see if you are affected and update your site and plugins immediately.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 22:42:26 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"WPTavern: Pippin Williamson on Building a Community Around Your Open Source Project";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=35573";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"http://wptavern.com/pippin-williamson-on-building-a-community-around-your-open-source-project";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10938:"<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/pippin-williamson.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[35573]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/pippin-williamson.jpg?resize=800%2C393" alt="photo credit: inQbation" class="size-full wp-image-35588" /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://www.inqbation.com/photos-of-wordpress-wordcamp-miami-2014/">inQbation</a>\n<p>When <a href="https://twitter.com/pippinsplugins" target="_blank">Pippin Williamson</a> launched <a href="https://easydigitaldownloads.com/" target="_blank">Easy Digital Downloads</a> in early 2012, he could not have predicted the success that the open source project is experiencing today. The core plugin is approaching half a million downloads and recently passed 100 <a href="https://github.com/easydigitaldownloads/Easy-Digital-Downloads/graphs/contributors" target="_blank">contributors</a> on GitHub. It provides the foundation for a profitable commercial marketplace of more than 190 extensions authored by the EDD community.</p>\n<h3>The Birth of Easy Digital Downloads</h3>\n<p>As is the case with many entrepreneurs, Williamson discovered one of his best ideas while solving one of his own problems. He had become an avid plugin developer long before EDD was in the picture. &#8220;I wanted a better way to sell WordPress plugins I was creating through my own site,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I had been using the Code Canyon marketplace from Envato for a while and had toyed with a few of the other e-commerce plugins, but I wanted something a bit different.&#8221; Williamson had no idea that EDD would soon become his full-time job.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When a project starts out that way, it&#8217;s really hard to guesstimate what the future holds for it. As I continued building on the plugin and making more generalized features that had a wider audience than just my site, it became apparent pretty quickly that others were looking for some of the same things. The project was started in March and by November of the same year, I really started to consider the prospect of it becoming a full-time job for me.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Williamson was inspired by Jigoshop&#8217;s and WooCommerce&#8217;s successes with the &#8220;extensions marketplace&#8221; business model. &#8220;As an outsider, it seemed as though the extensions model was working well for them, so I thought, &#8216;Why not?&#8217; It seemed like a good fit. Early on though I had no idea that we would reach more than 150 extensions in so short a time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He built the first couple of extensions for himself, including the Stripe integration. &#8220;Those first extensions were really the ones that proved building a marketplace around EDD wasn&#8217;t an utterly insane idea. Mostly insane but plausible.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Extensibility Has a Direct Correlation to Profitability</h3>\n<p>Easy Digital Downloads is well known for having a codebase that is easy to extend and friendly to developers. Williamson built this into the project out of principle from the early days of EDD, not knowing how vital extensibility would become further down the road.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It definitely started as a core philosophy but became a fundamental requirement as the project grew. EDD wouldn&#8217;t be even half as successful as it is now if it weren&#8217;t for the extensibility,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There are still severe pain points in terms of our extensibility, but they are being worked on for future releases. A commitment to always making the plugin more and more extensible is one of the things that has really helped us along the way.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Extensibility is the backbone of the EDD marketplace, and it&#8217;s paying off for Williamson and the project as a whole. On an average day, the core EDD plugin sees 400-1000 downloads. &#8220;The revenue of the project has grown consistently since first launching two and a half years ago,&#8221; Williamson said. &#8220;In its first year, we saw steady growth, but nothing amazing by any means. It was enough to tell me there was potential for much, much more.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In 2012, Williamson reports that the project pulled in $25,000 in extension sales, with one fifth of this paid out to third party developers for extension sales. Over the course of 2013, EDD grew its monthly revenue from ~$2,000 per month up to nearly $16,000 per month. Williamson finished that year with ~$190,000 in sales and paid out nearly $64,000 in commissions to third party developers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And now, just as we are wrapping up 2014, we have seen more than $456,000 in sales and have generated more than $200,000 in commissions for third party developers,&#8221; Williamson said. &#8220;In 2015 these numbers are expected to grow, just as they have for the last two years. To say we&#8217;re excited for the future would be to put it lightly.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Attracting and Keeping a Community of Contributors</h3>\n<p>Without EDD&#8217;s large community of contributors, the project&#8217;s success would have been severely limited. EDD seems to have an organic way of attracting and keeping contributors. Williamson attributes this to three key aspects of the community surrounding the project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>We work hard to always try and make new contributors few welcome.</strong> No one should ever be told (even indirectly) to go away when they are trying to give back to a project. By being open to criticism and suggestions from the community, and working to ensure the community feels encouraged to speak up, we have gained a lot of long-time contributors, simply because they didn&#8217;t feel like their suggestions were lost in a dark abyss of nothingness or intentionally ignored. When people feel welcomed, they tend to stick around.</li>\n<li><strong>Every suggestion gets an answer of some kind. Period.</strong> We strive to never leave a support ticket or github issue unanswered. Even if the answer is &#8220;no&#8221;, we still answer it. When people are ignored, they leave, so we never ignore anyone. Period.</li>\n<li><strong>We have actively asked people to help out on the project.</strong> There are tons of people out there ready, willing, and wanting to help; sometimes all it takes is an invitation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Williamson doesn&#8217;t think that any of these efforts are unique to EDD, but they have been the most important factors for growing and keeping a large contributor base. He aims to make sure every single contributor gets an answer to their suggestions, no matter how small the contribution or bug report. &#8220;If someone that is brand new to the project feels they have been ignored, how likely are they to ever come back? I think we see this a lot with WordPress core contributors,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There are hundreds of tickets on trac that have gone unanswered from new contributors, and I suspect a huge percentage of those people have decided to move on and not contribute since they felt ignored. <strong>It doesn&#8217;t matter if someone is actually ignored; it matters that they feel they were ignored.</strong>&#8221;</p>\n<p>In order to maintain a good follow-up process, Williamson has streamlined development of the core plugin through its GitHub repository. New contributors who want to get involved with extension or theme development also have access to a private Trello board where they can connect with other developers.</p>\n<h3>Advice for New Open Source Project Leaders</h3>\n<p>When reflecting on the early days of EDD, Williamson has a few regrets and encourages developers to think about the future when it comes to plugin architecture. &#8220;There is one major architectural change I would make, and that is the use of custom tables for storing data,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We opted out of using custom tables from day one, and that was a mistake. Not properly leveraging custom tables that had the exact database schema that we needed actually made it dramatically more work for us in the long run. We&#8217;ve had to jump through a lot of hoops to build advanced queries for solid store reporting.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This mistake has made it difficult to build EDD in a way that will scale the plugin up to a larger user base on larger websites, as needed. Williamson and contributors continue to find ways to deal with it but it is still costing the team a great deal more effort.</p>\n<p>On the community aspect of the project, he has a few simple tips for open source project leaders who want to attract a decent base of contributors.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be nice.</li>\n<li>Respond to everyone.</li>\n<li>Make it publicly known that you want contributions.</li>\n<li>Do what you can to make it easy (hint: asking people to email patches is not making it easy.)</li>\n<li>Be very open to criticism.</li>\n<li>Work hard to build an awesome product, as that alone will attract a certain number of interested in contributors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Holding to these principles has made Easy Digital Downloads a resounding success, as well as an inspirational example for WordPress plugin developers. Williamson hopes to expand operations to include a hosted version of the plugin, but doesn&#8217;t yet have a roadmap for how that will play out.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I would like to see a hosted version be available within the next year or two. We haven&#8217;t officially decided if we will offer one or if we will seek partnering with an agency or other group, but I&#8217;d love to see it come about,&#8221; he said. If he&#8217;s able to launch a hosted version, Williamson will have the opportunity to tap into a whole new demographic of customers, many of whom are likely not developers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never run a hosted service before so it will be a whole new experience for me with a whole new set of challenges,&#8221; he said. Williamson counts the strong EDD community as one of his assets in pursuing this new venture:</p>\n<blockquote><p>One advantage that I feel we will have, however, is the rapid development pace that having a strong community of contributors affords us. As we iterate quickly on the self-hosted version, those same changes will be able to be applied to a hosted version. It will also be able to go in reverse: as we test out new features in a hosted version, we can apply those same changes upstream to the self-hosted version. Much like WordPress.org and WordPress.com.</p></blockquote>\n<p>With a large number of people building extensions for the project, and a regular stream of contributions and bug fixes, Williamson and EDD are uniquely prepared to support a hosted version. The success of <a href="https://easydigitaldownloads.com/" target="_blank">Easy Digital Downloads</a> demonstrates the value of building a strong community around your open source project. With the right cultivation and a healthy community, any quality project can become more profitable and prepared for the future.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 20:19:23 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:78:"WPTavern: The Majority of Shark Tank Contestants Use WordPress and WooCommerce";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=35540";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:88:"http://wptavern.com/the-majority-of-shark-tank-contestants-use-wordpress-and-woocommerce";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2055:"<p>Have you ever wondered what CMS and eCommerce system <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_Tank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_Tank">Shark Tank</a> contestants use?

They also manually investigated each site to determine some of the more complex setups. Factors WP Engine looked for include: if the site was still active, site-wide SSL implementation, and what kind of eCommerce solutions are being used. Here are a few highlights from the infographic.</p>\n<p>WordPress is the most popular platform, followed by Shopify and Magento. One of the most disappointing discoveries is that out of 341 websites, only 39 have SSL support. SSL is important because it provides a level of encryption between you and the server. It also protects customer information which is extremely important if you&#8217;re going to sell things online.</p>\n<p>For over a year, Magento was the eCommerce system of choice, but it&#8217;s now in second place. WooCommerce is now the most popular eCommerce system used by Shark Tank contestants. This makes sense since WordPress is the most popular platform and WooCommere is built to be used with WordPress.</p>\n<p>Check out the rest of the data in the image below and let us know if any of the data surprises you.

Over the past six years, the API has experienced dwindling support across multiple platforms, especially on mobile.

For the first six months of 2015, he will be working full-time to push the BuddyPress, bbPress, and GlotPress projects forward.</p>\n<p>Jacoby is essentially pioneering a new way of working as an open source developer funded by the community. There&#8217;s no prescription for how to tackle each project&#8217;s goals, but working remotely in the past has uniquely prepared him for this opportunity.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Previous experience working mostly independently and remotely certainly doesn&#8217;t hurt, particularly for things like consistent communication and maintaining momentum,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It will be nice to get back into the swing of posting public status updates and more strictly planning out my days and weeks again. I appreciate the freedom I&#8217;ve had since July, but being completely without structure can be risky, too.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Jacoby anticipates splitting his time equally between BuddyPress, bbPress, and GlotPress. &#8220;In my imagination, fairly evenly in priority order for a few of the long standing issues that have been prohibiting enhancements to WordPress.org, specifically for the Rosetta sites,&#8221; he said. &#8220;GlotPress will require a little more time for me to start being helpful, so I&#8217;ll likely try to focus on the BuddyPress and bbPress queue first.&#8221;</p>\n<p>What will a typical day look like for Jacoby when he starts working full-time on the sister projects? He plans to be involved in every aspect, from writing code to mentoring to adding codex contributions.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think a typical day will look like a cup of coffee, reading Trac and Slack, providing feedback and mentorship, and shepherding as much activity as I can. That might mean committing patches and doing feature development, increasing unit test coverage and working on the codex, or helping with tools to enable others to contribute easier. There is no shortage of things to do, and I&#8217;ll be looking at ways to multiply my efforts to get the maximum value out of the time I have.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If the development project is successful, other developers may be inspired to create similar campaigns. Jacoby isn&#8217;t the only one with the capability to make a strong impact on these projects. He believes that there are many others who would be able to do that same.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I really hope people look at this campaign as something they can try, too. Stephen Edgar has been absolutely killing it all across .org, so removing that barrier for him is a priority of mine. Mathieu Viet keeps putting out comprehensive BuddyPress concepts that could make their way into core with just a bit more free time and focus. Ryan McCue already volunteers a huge amount of time; imagine if he was 100% focused. </p>\n<p>Matt Gross (currently at 10up) is such a fast learner and can really crank stuff out quickly. Alison Barrett (also currently at 10up) is the same way; crazy fast at learning and implementing new things. I&#8217;d love to work with either of them on the bb&#8217;s again. A few of these individuals may not require outside funding, but it&#8217;s an interesting idea to use it as an option to reduce an employer&#8217;s monetary burden.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Working full-time on open source community projects without distraction, while still paying the bills, is a rare opportunity that Jacoby intends to maximize. If all goes as planned, the first half of 2015 will bring about the removal of the projects&#8217; most pressing hindrances. The success of Jacoby&#8217;s campaign demonstrates that the WordPress community believes in the potential of BuddyPress, bbPress, and GlotPress enough to invest in a trustworthy developer to make dedicated improvements.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 22:01:29 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:39:"WPTavern: A Newbie’s Guide to bbPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=35431";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"http://wptavern.com/a-newbies-guide-to-bbpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7392:"<p>If you&#8217;re brand new to <a title="http://bbpress.org/" href="http://bbpress.org/">bbPress</a>, you may not know about some of the ways it can be extended beyond being a simple forum. Additional functionality can be added with plugins, its output can be manipulated through CSS, and development is easy to keep up with. Even though bbPress has a <a title="https://codex.bbpress.org/getting-started-with-bbpress/" href="https://codex.bbpress.org/getting-started-with-bbpress/">getting started</a> guide available, I came up with my own mini guide. Here are some tips to get you started on building a bbPress forum.</p>\n<h2>Where to Find Plugins</h2>\n<p>bbPress is a plugin that was designed to be extended by other plugins. Once installed and configured, simply browse the plugin directory from the backend of WordPress and search for bbPress. There are at least 314 plugins that show up in the search results, not including the ones hosted on Github.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bbPressPlugins.png" rel="prettyphoto[35431]"><img class="size-full wp-image-35455" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bbPressPlugins.png?resize=1025%2C526" alt="bbPress Plugins in The WordPress Plugin Directory" /></a>bbPress Plugins in The WordPress Plugin Directory\n<p>Even though bbPress.org has a <a title="https://bbpress.org/plugins/" href="https://bbpress.org/plugins/">section dedicated to plugins</a>, it&#8217;s essentially an alternative to browsing the WordPress plugin directory. Instead of being able to view all of the plugins available, the pages only list bbPress specific plugins.</p>\n<p>Similar to WordPress, bbPress <a title="http://codex.bbpress.org/feature-plugins-tracking/" href="http://codex.bbpress.org/feature-plugins-tracking/">has a list of feature plugins</a> that may one day, be merged into core. The list contains plugins that offer features found in most forum software out of the box, so it&#8217;s a good place to start when adding features. Pay close attention to the <strong>Last Updated:</strong> information as I encountered a lot of plugins that haven&#8217;t been updated in over 2 years.</p>\n<h2>Altering The Look and Feel</h2>\n<p>bbPress comes with built-in theme support where all required elements such as front-end editing are included. If a WordPress theme doesn&#8217;t have support for the various elements that make up bbPress, you&#8217;ll still be able to use it. The built-in support makes it compatible with nearly every WordPress theme. However, I strongly encourage you to use a theme that is bbPress compatible as it almost always looks better than the default.</p>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bbPressCompatibleThemes.png" rel="prettyphoto[35431]"><img class="size-full wp-image-35467" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bbPressCompatibleThemes.png?resize=1025%2C810" alt="Free bbPress Compatible Themes" /></a>Free bbPress Compatible Themes\n<p>A <a title="https://wordpress.org/themes/search.php?q=bbPress" href="https://wordpress.org/themes/search.php?q=bbPress">search of the theme directory</a> indicates four pages of free WordPress themes that are explicitly compatible with bbPress. If you&#8217;d simply like to override the default markup to give it a custom look, check out <a title="https://codex.bbpress.org/theme-compatibility/" href="https://codex.bbpress.org/theme-compatibility/">this Codex article</a>.</p>\n<h2>How to Keep up With Development</h2>\n<p>While WordPress releases three major versions a year, bbPress averages two a year. So far in 2014, there have been no major versions released. Compared to WordPress, bbPress development occurs at a slower pace due to a smaller number of people contributing and spending time on the project. Not only does this make it easy to keep up with changes, it increases the opportunity to influence the project.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bbPressDevelopment.png" rel="prettyphoto[35431]"><img class="size-full wp-image-35469" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bbPressDevelopment.png?resize=946%2C691" alt="bbPress Development" /></a>bbPress Development\n<p>bbPress uses <a title="https://bbpress.trac.wordpress.org/timeline" href="https://bbpress.trac.wordpress.org/timeline">Trac for development</a> where user&#8217;s can submit bug reports and patches. If you use <a title="https://slack.com/" href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>, you can join the #bbPress channel where core developers and contributors hang out. This is a great way to get in touch with people and communicate in real-time.</p>\n<h2>Where to Get Support</h2>\n<p>The best way to get support is through the official <a title="https://bbpress.org/forums/" href="https://bbpress.org/forums/">bbPress forum</a>. While not as active as the WordPress support forum, there&#8217;s still a good amount of activity that takes place. It&#8217;s also monitored by all of the core developers.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bbPressSupport.png" rel="prettyphoto[35431]"><img class="size-full wp-image-35517" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bbPressSupport.png?resize=986%2C575" alt="bbPress Support Forum" /></a>bbPress Support Forum\n<p>The bbPress support forums follow the same rules and guidelines set forth by the WordPress support forums. There are two documents you should read to familiarize yourself to how it works. <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_the_Support_Forums">Using the Support Forum</a> and the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Forum_Welcome">Forum Welcome message</a>.</p>\n<h2>bbPress Nomenclature</h2>\n<p>bbPress has a set of nomenclature that is different from forum software you may have used in the past. This small guide explains what each term means.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Forums</strong> – Are segments of the main forum similar to categories.</li>\n<li><strong>Topics</strong> – Topics are created within forums, they are the issues that are being discussed.</li>\n<li><strong>Replies</strong> – Replies are made to topics, this is the actual discussion.</li>\n<li><strong>Voices</strong> &#8211; Voices represent the number of individuals participating in a conversation</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Next Six Months</h2>\n<p>Although development has come to a crawl in recent months, it&#8217;s encouraging that John James Jacoby <a title="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/buddypress-bbpress-glotpress-development" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/buddypress-bbpress-glotpress-development">successfully reached his crowd funding goal</a> as bbPress will likely experience a surge in development and community based contributions over the next six months. Hopefully, the next six months are among the project&#8217;s brightest.</p>\n<h2>Codex Volunteer</h2>\n<p>The documentation and organization of documents on the bbPress.org website leaves a lot to be desired.

As Vagrant development environments are a daily staple of work life at WDS, the team needed a faster way for setting up new WordPress sites with VVV.</p>\n<p><a href="https://github.com/bradp/vv" target="_blank">Variable VVV</a> is their solution, a script that automates the creation and deletion of new WordPress sites using VVV. The script is based on Alison Barrett&#8217;s <a href="http://wptavern.com/vvv-site-wizard-automates-the-creation-and-deletion-of-wordpress-development-sites" target="_blank">VVV Site Wizard</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The original site wizard hasn&#8217;t been updated in about half a year. I&#8217;ve designed this to be a drop-in replacement,&#8221; Parbs told the Tavern. &#8220;All the flags and commands from vvv-site-wizard function 100% the same, so you can just install this and start using it exactly the same.&#8221; Anyone who has used the VVV Site Wizard in the past will be comfortable using Variable VVV right away.</p>\n<p>The new script has a few additional features beyond the original VVV Site Wizard, including the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The ability to pass vagrant command through to VVV</li>\n<li>An easier way to set your VVV installation path</li>\n<li>The ability to clone a git-repo as wp-content</li>\n<li>The ability to set more installation options</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While creating the script, Parbs went through the issues list at the vvv-site-wizard repository and fixed a number of issues. He sees Variable VVV as the spiritual successor to the original tool and has designed it to be a bit easier to use. He noted that it takes just 1/3 the time to type the commands and the command results have also been vastly improved. &#8220;One example is the <code>list</code> command to show you all sites. With vvv-site-wizard, it is a plain list of site names. <code>vv list</code> will show you a colorized output, along with URLs and marking VVV defaults,&#8221; Parbs explained.</p>\n<p>The WebDevStudios team has an extensive roadmap of features for future implementation. Parbs is most excited about the idea of &#8220;blueprints,&#8221; which would offer the ability to install themes and plugins while setting up a new site.</p>\n<blockquote><p>A blueprint would define a list of plugins, themes, mu-plugins, and various site options. When installing, you could grab that blueprint and it would set it all up. I&#8217;m planning on letting you grab from Github, WP.org, a zip file link, etc. I&#8217;ve <a href="https://github.com/bradp/vv/issues/5" target="_blank">outlined the idea</a> on GitHub. You&#8217;d setup multiple blueprints, and when you do an install, you could grab a blueprint and use that. For example, an &#8216;ecommerce&#8217; blueprint might install WooCommerce, some other plugins, and _s, or whatever you like.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As the VVV Site Wizard doesn&#8217;t seem to be maintained anymore, Parbs plans to keep Variable VVV going and has also outlined a number of other enhancements in the project&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/bradp/vv/issues" target="_blank">issues queue</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enable vv to auto-update itself</li>\n<li>Add deployment capability</li>\n<li>Delete site database during removal</li>\n<li>Add option to add dummy content when creating site</li>\n<li>Allow overriding of /htdocs install location</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Parbs plans to add anything that will make developers&#8217; lives easier at WebDevStudios, but he is also open to suggestions. &#8220;I&#8217;ve built the script to be extremely easy to add new functionality, so implementing features people request will be as easy as possible,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The script is now ready for public use. &#8220;Over the past few days, a few people here at WebDevStudios have been beta-testing it, and its really solid,&#8221; Parbs said. <a href="https://github.com/bradp/vv" target="_blank">Variable VVV</a> is now publicly available on GitHub for anyone who wants to use it or contribute back to the project. If you test the script, make sure to leave your feedback and suggestions in the project&#8217;s issues list, as WebDevStudios plans to consistently maintain and extend the tool to make it better.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 12 Dec 2014 19:47:27 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"WPTavern: Idea Factory: A Frontend Submission and Voting System for WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=35416";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:86:"http://wptavern.com/idea-factory-a-frontend-submission-and-voting-system-for-wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4173:"<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/idea-factory.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[35416]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/idea-factory.jpg?resize=631%2C300" alt="idea-factory" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35420" /></a></p>\n<p>One of the oldest and simplest ways of accessing public opinion is through an up/down voting system. When offered in a controlled setting where everyone has the chance to vote, the system causes the best ideas to float to the top.</p>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/idea-factory/" target="_blank">Idea Factory</a> is a plugin designed to make it easy for WordPress administrators to set up a voting system where users can submit new ideas from the frontend. The plugin was created by <a href="http://nickhaskins.co/" target="_blank">Nick Haskins</a>, author of the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/aesop-story-engine/" target="_blank">Aesop Story Engine</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Idea Factory was born out of necessity, and the frustration of the lack of plugins that did exactly what I wanted it to do,&#8221;</strong> Haskins wrote in the plugin&#8217;s description. His implementation is simple but built to be extensible, offering developers a number of <a href="https://github.com/bearded-avenger/idea-factory/wiki" target="_blank">filters, hooks, and actions</a>. Idea Factory features the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AJAX powered front-end submission and voting</li>\n<li>Voting is limited to logged-in users</li>\n<li>1 vote allowed per user per idea</li>\n<li>Emails the admin with notification of a new submission</li>\n<li>Extensible with hooks and actions on events</li>\n<li>More ideas loaded with AJAX on front-end</li>\n<li>Mobile friendly</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Logged-in users can enter new ideas via a modal submission box. The plugin creates an Idea custom post type and data is stored in post_meta and user_meta tables.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/idea-submit.png" rel="prettyphoto[35416]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/idea-submit.png?resize=900%2C783" alt="idea-submit" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35452" /></a></p>\n<p>Ideas are displayed at yoursite.com/ideas. Users can only vote once on each idea before they are locked out. Up votes push ideas to the top and down votes send ideas further down the list.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ideas.png" rel="prettyphoto[35416]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ideas.png?resize=1025%2C537" alt="ideas" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35432" /></a></p>\n<p>The design is generic enough to drop nicely into any theme, but you can further customize it by copying the file from the plugin&#8217;s /template-ideas/ directory into your theme. Idea Factory&#8217;s settings also allow you to disable the core CSS file from loading so that you can take full control.</p>\n<p>Each idea and its description can be edited in the admin. If you have a highly active voting board, you may want to turn off email notifications for new submissions. The settings also include an option to hold all new ideas as drafts to be approved before publishing.</p>\n<p>After testing Idea Factory, I was impressed with how easy it was to set up and use. Both idea creation and voting are anonymous, but it might be nice to have an option to display users for each. However, one of the best things about Idea Factory is that it maintains a limited set of features in favor of keeping the plugin lean and extensible.</p>\n<p>An idea voting system can help community managers or developers get a better idea of where to invest their time and how to prioritize new features. It&#8217;s a quick way to take the temperature of your user base, because it allows them to freely express their ideas and participate in voting up the best ones. It&#8217;s also far less time-consuming than conducting a survey.

Theme authors submitting new themes to the official directory must ensure that all text strings are translatable. This also applies to any updates to existing themes.</p>\n<h3>Tips for Making Your Theme Translation-Ready</h3>\n<p>The WordPress Theme Review Handbook doesn&#8217;t yet contain a section with information about preparing themes for translation. However, you can find all the basics on <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/internationalization/" target="_blank">how to internationalize a theme</a> in the WordPress Theme Developer Handbook, which is still a work in progress.</p>\n<p>The internationalization section also links to a number of videos and tutorials in its resources section. Many of these will be helpful in walking theme developers through the process of preparing themes for translation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/" target="_blank">GNU gettext utilities</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJfqgrzjEis" target="_blank">i18n: Preparing Your WordPress Theme for the World</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://wordpress.tv/2014/02/26/samuel-otto-wood-on-internationalization-plugins-and-themes-for-the-whole-world/" target="_blank">Samuel “Otto” Wood: On Internationalization: Plugins and Themes for the Whole World</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://pippinsplugins.com/use-wp_localize_script-it-is-awesome/" target="_blank">Use wp_localize_script, It Is Awesome</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://wordpress.tv/2009/11/14/ze-fontainhas-i18n-nyc09/" target="_blank">Zé Fontainhas: Lost in Translation—i18n and WordPress</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://ottopress.com/2012/internationalization-youre-probably-doing-it-wrong/" target="_blank">Internationalization: You’re Probably Doing It Wrong</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a WordPress theme isn&#8217;t translatable, then the site it is running on is limited to the theme author&#8217;s language. If you invest your time and hard work into creating a WordPress theme, why not make sure that it&#8217;s able to be used all over the world?</p>\n<p>The new requirement from the Theme Review team is a major milestone in expanding WordPress&#8217; global reach. The official themes directory is often the first place that self-hosted WordPress users look when shopping for themes. The new translation-ready requirement will help ensure that WordPress.org&#8217;s vast library of themes are ready for global use.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 11 Dec 2014 18:34:09 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64:"WPTavern: A New User’s Experience Installing and Using bbPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=35320";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"http://wptavern.com/a-new-users-experience-installing-and-using-bbpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8214:"<p>bbPress is a <a title="https://bbpress.org/about/the-story/" href="https://bbpress.org/about/the-story/">10 year old project</a> that&#8217;s supposed to make it easy to attach a forum to WordPress. On the day after Christmas in 2004, Matt Mullenweg spent an entire weekend coding an alternative to <a title="http://minibb.net/" href="http://minibb.net/">miniBB</a>, from the ground up that at the time, powered the WordPress support forums. bbPress was stand-alone software until 2011, when the <a title="http://wptavern.com/bbpress-2-0-stable-now-available" href="http://wptavern.com/bbpress-2-0-stable-now-available">release of 2.0</a> transformed it into a WordPress plugin,</p>\n<p>Over the years, I&#8217;ve kept a close eye on bbPress but I&#8217;ve never used it for a project of my own. Since I&#8217;m only a new user once, I decided to document my experience of configuring and using it for the first time.</p>\n<h2>Activation and Configuration</h2>\n<p>Locating bbPress is easy as it usually shows up as a Featured Plugin on the Add New plugin screen. Once activated, a welcome screen displays information on what&#8217;s new, credits, and a link at the bottom to visit the forum settings.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bbPressActivated.png" rel="prettyphoto[35320]"><img class="size-full wp-image-35359" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bbPressActivated.png?resize=1025%2C697" alt="bbPress Welcome Screen After Activation" /></a>bbPress Welcome Screen After Activation\n<p>When visiting the forum settings screen, I&#8217;m presented with a list of options with checkboxes and numbers. While there are not a lot of things to configure, I think a better presentation of the various options would be to split each major section into a tab of its own. Although it was my choice to visit the forum settings from the Welcome screen, I think the Welcome screen is a good place to use Admin Pointers to help new users create a new topic, forum, etc. I don&#8217;t understand why the Welcome screen has a link to forum settings since a new install won&#8217;t have anything to configure.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bbPressOptions.png" rel="prettyphoto[35320]"><img class="size-full wp-image-35360" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bbPressOptions.png?resize=765%2C888" alt="bbPress Forum Settings Screen" /></a>bbPress Forum Settings Screen\n<p>While on the forum settings screen, I&#8217;m not sure what it is I&#8217;m supposed to configure in order for the forum to display on the frontend. At this point, I visit the <a title="http://codex.bbpress.org/" href="http://codex.bbpress.org/">Documentation section</a> of bbPress.org and locate a <a title="https://codex.bbpress.org/getting-started/" href="https://codex.bbpress.org/getting-started/">Getting Started</a> guide. It turns out, the guide is of no use to me or anyone else for that matter.</p>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/GettingStartedToNowhere.png" rel="prettyphoto[35320]"><img class="size-full wp-image-35361" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/GettingStartedToNowhere.png?resize=986%2C499" alt="Getting Started To Nowhere" /></a>Getting Started To Nowhere\n<p>The left hand sidebar has a list of related links which point to several different articles on user roles, conditional tags, and functions. It took some effort on my part, but I finally found the article on <a title="https://codex.bbpress.org/getting-started-with-bbpress/" href="https://codex.bbpress.org/getting-started-with-bbpress/">Getting Started with bbPress</a>. This page should be linked to from the <a title="http://codex.bbpress.org/" href="http://codex.bbpress.org/">Documentation main page</a> for the Getting Started link. This simple change will save users time and frustration.</p>\n<h2>Creating Forums</h2>\n<p>Using the Getting Started guide, I created my first forum. Since forums are Custom Post Types, the forum editor looks similar to the Post Editor. It would be nice if hints displayed above each field so users understand which part of the forum they&#8217;re connected to. For example, the title field should have a hint that says &#8220;Name of the forum&#8221; and above the editor, text that says, &#8220;A description of the forum&#8221;. Some of the items on the Forum creation screen make sense but it shouldn&#8217;t be assumed the user knows what each field corresponds to.</p>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/CreatingAForumInbbPress.png" rel="prettyphoto[35320]"><img class="size-full wp-image-35362" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/CreatingAForumInbbPress.png?resize=889%2C584" alt="Creating a Forum in bbPress" /></a>Creating a Forum in bbPress\n<p>There are two different types of forums, <strong>forum</strong> and <strong>category</strong>. Forums contain topics and can be the parent of other forums. Categories can only contain forums and are primarily used as a method of organization. The nomenclature used is enough to make anyone&#8217;s head spin.</p>\n<h2>Creating Topics</h2>\n<p>After creating a forum, I moved on to create a topic. Topics are similar to typical forum posts. Topics are one of the three <a title="https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types#Custom_Types" href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types#Custom_Types">Custom Post Types </a>created by bbPress, which means the Topic editor uses the same interface you&#8217;d see when writing a post. Similar to creating forums, I&#8217;d like to see the fields labeled for consistency. Creating topics from the backend of WordPress is fairly easy after creating the first forum.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bbPressTopicCreated.png" rel="prettyphoto[35320]"><img class="size-full wp-image-35365" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/bbPressTopicCreated.png?resize=898%2C668" alt="bbPress Topic Created From The Backend of WordPress" /></a>bbPress Topic Created From The Backend of WordPress\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The Frontend of bbPress</h2>\n<p>Everything up to this point has been managed from the backend of WordPress. I&#8217;ve created a category, forum, and topic. It&#8217;s time to see how bbPress works on the frontend. Replying to a topic is straight forward. A form is supplied with quick tag support so visitors can easily style text. After hitting the submit button, the page reloads and the reply is shown. Sometimes, replies don&#8217;t show up immediately because they&#8217;re moderated by Akismet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ReplyingToATopic.png" rel="prettyphoto[35320]"><img class="size-full wp-image-35368" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ReplyingToATopic.png?resize=684%2C795" alt="Replying to a Topic on The Frontend of bbPress" /></a>Replying to a Topic on The Frontend of bbPress\n<p>Once I got a handle for how bbPress is structured and what categories, forums, topics, and replies look like, I went back to the Forum Settings page.</p>\n<h2>Not Easy Enough</h2>\n<p>bbPress is a plugin, and because of that, I expect to be able to turn it on and have everything ready to go. As you can see from my experience, it doesn&#8217;t always work out that way, especially when using a theme that doesn&#8217;t support it out of the box. The <a title="https://codex.bbpress.org/getting-started-with-bbpress/" href="https://codex.bbpress.org/getting-started-with-bbpress/">Getting Started</a> guide is important information on understanding how to configure bbPress. Without it, I&#8217;d be lost in the dark.</p>\n<p>My initial experience is rough around the edges and at times frustrating, as I couldn&#8217;t easily find the help I needed. I can only imagine how many others have gone through the same experience. Hopefully, a few changes will be made to bbPress and its website to create a smoother new user experience.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve recently installed or used bbPress for the first time, tell us about your experience in the comments.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 11 Dec 2014 04:52:15 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"WPTavern: Change Post Types with the Post Type Switcher Plugin for WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=35093";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:86:"http://wptavern.com/change-post-types-with-the-post-type-switcher-plugin-for-wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4408:"<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/train-switch.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[35093]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/train-switch.jpg?resize=1024%2C492" alt="photo credit: contemplative imaging - cc" class="size-full wp-image-35340" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/thomas-merton/4334175428/">contemplative imaging</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/">cc</a>\n<p>When WordPress 3.0 introduced the ability for developers to register their own <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types#Custom_Post_Types" target="_blank">custom post types</a>, the software became far more flexible for use as a content management system. This was a major turning point for WordPress, as it gave developers a standard way to structure custom content with core-supported features.</p>\n<p>Four years later, custom post types are so commonly used that folks occasionally need a way to switch a post from one type to another. A site admin may want to change how content is structured and presented, and switching content to a new post type can be a huge time saver in some instances.</p>\n<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-type-switcher/" target="_blank">Post Type Switcher</a> plugin, authored by <a href="http://jaco.by/" target="_blank">John James Jacoby</a>, was created for exactly this purpose. It&#8217;s one of those plugins that you may not have ever known about until you&#8217;re on the hunt to find a way to convert a post from one type to another.</p>\n<p>The plugin adds a simple post type dropdown to the post editor, which allows you to reassign any post to a new post type.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/post-type-switcher.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[35093]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/post-type-switcher.jpg?resize=772%2C250" alt="post-type-switcher" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35321" /></a></p>\n<p>The handy thing is that Post Type Switcher can convert nearly every combination of posts, pages, attachments, custom post types, etc:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Page to Post</li>\n<li>Post to Page</li>\n<li>Page to Attachment</li>\n<li>Post to Custom</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What happens when you change a post to a different type? Only the <code>\'post_type\'</code> property of a post is changed. Categories, tags, and custom taxonomies all remain untouched. Featured images remain in place. The post&#8217;s URL will change to whatever the new post type uses. For example, if you change a regular post to a testimonial post type that uses /testimonial/ in the URL, your newly converted post will follow the pattern of its new post type.</p>\n<p>The old post URL should 404 so that you can use a plugin to redirect to the new URL or add some custom rewrite rules to your .htaccess file. While testing the plugin with different post types, I only encountered one instance where a plugin didn&#8217;t properly 404 the original post, but most of the time you won&#8217;t have an issue with this.</p>\n<p>Jacoby has purposely excluded invisible post types, such as revisions, menus, etc., but you can filter <code>\'pts_post_type_filter\'</code> to change how this works if you need access to more post types.</p>\n<p><a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/beatpanda/" target="_blank">Matthew Gerring</a>, a contributor to the plugin, helped to add bulk editing so that you can select all posts in a certain type and convert them to a new type with one quick action.</p>\n<p>Post Type Switcher is very useful if you started out putting content in regular posts but now want to move it into a portfolio plugin or testimonial plugin. Or perhaps you&#8217;ve been running bbPress on your site and want to extract a few of the most active posts to become regular blog posts instead. Another common use might be to convert a bunch of posts to pages in order to create a static reference section for your site.

The latest ‘v1’ reboot has been praised and I often receive nice comments from users even though development has slowed of late.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Due to time constraints, Jolley placed Download Monitor up for adoption. <a title="http://www.barrykooij.com/" href="http://www.barrykooij.com">Barry Kooij</a>, a coworker of Jolley&#8217;s, adopted the plugin.

The startup, created by Jonathan Kay, came in second, behind <a href="http://wpcurve.com/" title="WP Curve" target="_blank">WP Curve</a>, in the first round of <a href="http://mattreport.com/episode-1-wordpress-startup-challenge/" target="_blank">Matt Report&#8217;s WordPress Startup Challenge</a>.</p>\n<p>The new service aims to create the most convenient way to stage a WordPress site, with 1-click copying from production to staging and 1-click to merge the changes back into the live site. WP Stagecoach offers a plugin that hooks your site up to the service with an API key. Staging sites are hosted on WP Stagecoach&#8217;s servers.</p>\n<p>The beta version of the service currently includes the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a staging copy of your live site with one click.</li>\n<li>Copy changes from your staging site back to your live site.</li>\n<li>Choose which changes to import. You can import some or all of your file changes, and/or your database changes.</li>\n<li>Password-protect your staging site.</li>\n<li>Staging site runs on WP Stagecoach&#8217;s server – no need to set up hosting for your staging site.</li>\n<li>Revert file changes if importing from your staging site doesn’t go as expected.</li>\n<li>Staging sites can be accessed via SSL-encryption</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After testing the beta on a simple blog, I found that the build process took several minutes. Once the site is created, you&#8217;ll be given SFTP/FTP login credentials and URL for your staging site. The site that WP Stagecoach creates is instantly public, which has me worried about duplicate content. If you use the service, you&#8217;ll want to log in and install a maintenance plugin to hide the staging site from the public.</p>\n<p>If an import gets interrupted, the plugin can pick up where it left off, which is helpful for larger sites. It also includes an advanced debug mode for tracking down problems.</p>\n<p>All of the staging sites are hosted on a standard LAMP stack, and users will not be able to reproduce their exact hosting environment with the service when it launches. For many people, the stack will be similar enough to their host and will cause no issues. However, if you are running on a more customized hosting environment, WP Stagecoach will likely not be suitable for creating your staging site.</p>\n<p>WP Stagecoach has plans to make it possible for users to create a staging site on their own servers, but this feature will be further down the road. When the team is able to add this, it will make the product a much more versatile tool for WordPress developers.</p>\n<p>At the moment, the service is very promising and offers a highly convenient way to create a staging site for a simple WordPress site on a standard LAMP stack. Those with a more customized server environment will have to look elsewhere for the time being.

The Sunrise is a conference where founders of Australia&#8217;s iconic startups describe the early years of their business. The presentation is 15 minutes in length with 30 minutes dedicated to questions.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of great information in the presentation, especially if you&#8217;re running a bootstrapped business. I also admire Ta&#8217;eed&#8217;s delivery as he comes off as a straight shooter. He reminds me of myself when I tried to launch a business several years ago.</p>\n<h2>Presentation Highlights</h2>\n<p>Envato began as a stock Flash template marketplace called Flash Den. Flash Den was eventually renamed to Active Den due to Adobe owning the trademarks associated with Flash.</p>\n<p>Envato started with $30k and is still a bootstrapped company.

So far, he has not accepted any outside funding.</p>\n<p><a title="http://appstorm.net/" href="http://appstorm.net/">AppStorm</a> was the precursor to the Apple App Store. Before Ta&#8217;eed could turn AppStorm into an app marketplace, Apple released the App Store crushing his idea.</p>\n<p>At 32:26, Ta&#8217;eed is asked how he came up with the name Envato. He bought it from <a title="https://www.brandbucket.com/" href="https://www.brandbucket.com/">Brandbucket</a> for $1k.</p>\n<p>At 38:50, Ta&#8217;eed is asked to describe how massive the Envato marketplace is. His response, &#8220;We sell something every 6 seconds, we sell a million WordPress theme per year, and we have the largest stock music marketplace by volume with a million tracks licensed each year.&#8221;</p>\n<p>At 42:52, Ta&#8217;eed is asked about Envato&#8217;s relationship to WordPress. He admits to the licensing challenges and mentions that, when Envato started selling WordPress themes, he didn&#8217;t know what the GPL was. He describes the relationship as symbiotic.</p>\n<p><span class="embed-youtube"></span></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 09 Dec 2014 02:35:34 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"WPTavern: Manage Multiple WordPress Sites with WPDASH, Now in Beta";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=27624";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:75:"http://wptavern.com/manage-multiple-wordpress-sites-with-wpdash-now-in-beta";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2721:"<p><a href="http://en.wpdash.io/" target="_blank">WPDASH</a> is a new service that launched in beta today, created by a group of WordPress developers in Poland.

The <a href="http://jetpack.me/support/contact-form/" target="_blank">Contact Form</a> module is one of its most popular features, as nearly every site requires a way for visitors to get in touch. The module is reliable and easy to use but fairly basic in terms of features.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Jetpack makes it easy for you to extend its features with a plugin. <a href="http://www.hughlashbrooke.com/" target="_blank">Hugh Lashbrooke</a>, who has authored more than a dozen plugins hosted on WordPress.org, has just released <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack-contact-form-auto-reply/" target="_blank">Jetpack Contact Form Auto Reply</a> to make it easy for site admins to issue an automatic message in response to a contact form submission.</p>\n<p>The plugin adds a new Auto Reply sub-menu item under the Jetpack menu, with settings for two useful features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Craft a custom reply message using the WordPress WYSIWYG editor</li>\n<li>Set a unique from name and address for auto replies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can even add rich text or images to the custom reply message, which makes it easy to brand your communications for your company or organization.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/auto-reply.png" rel="prettyphoto[35098]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/auto-reply.png?resize=1025%2C401" alt="auto-reply" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35107" /></a></p>\n<p>The auto reply message could be something as simple as &#8220;We have received your request and will contact you shortly.&#8221; Or perhaps it&#8217;s a holiday and you want to update the auto reply to notify people of any delays in response time, i.e. &#8220;We will be out of the office until January 3, 2015.&#8221; This plugin provides an easy way to do that in the WordPress admin, without having to set up an auto-responder in your email.</p>\n<p>Lashbrooke originally created the plugin for his own use, because he was receiving numerous messages from people asking for support for his plugins hosted on WordPress.org and WooThemes.com. His custom auto reply message is designed to help point people to the appropriate forum, in case they contacted him for support-related questions.</p>\n<p>After testing the plugin, I can confirm that it works as advertised. The only tricky part is the last setting on the page, which calls for the label of the field in the contact form that contains the email address to use for the auto reply. You have to correctly identify this label or it won&#8217;t send. In my case the label was &#8216;Email,&#8217; which is likely to be a common one.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/auto-reply-email-settings.png" rel="prettyphoto[35098]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/auto-reply-email-settings.png?resize=1025%2C279" alt="auto-reply-email-settings" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35108" /></a></p>\n<p>While an auto reply might seem redundant, since Jetpack already displays a confirmation of the message sending successfully, that extra note in your visitor&#8217;s inbox can be reassuring, especially since it allows them to reply to the email if necessary. You can never underestimate the importance of communication in a customer&#8217;s decision-making process.</p>\n<p>Jetpack Contact Form Auto Reply is a handy add-on for the millions of Jetpack users out there who use the Contact Form module. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack-contact-form-auto-reply/" target="_blank">Download</a> it from WordPress.org.

Its popularity is made up of many facets including, the community, themes and plugins. In the realm of open source content management systems, nothing comes close to what WordPress has accomplished. Although it&#8217;s the market leader, its dominance won&#8217;t last forever.</p>\n<p>Mike Johnston of CMS Critic asks, &#8220;<a title="http://www.cmscritic.com/what-it-will-take-to-dethrone-wordpress/" href="http://www.cmscritic.com/what-it-will-take-to-dethrone-wordpress/">What It Will Take to Dethrone WordPress?</a>&#8221; In the article, Johnston explains why WordPress is on top and why Ghost is on the right path to possibly achieving similar success.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve seen some successful upstarts come out of the wood work to try to take a piece of the pie and some are doing quite well in gaining momentum. One particular contender that comes to mind is Ghost.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While Ghost is doing well in its own right, <a title="http://wptavern.com/why-wordpress-doesnt-need-to-fear-ghost-yet" href="http://wptavern.com/why-wordpress-doesnt-need-to-fear-ghost-yet">I don&#8217;t think</a> it will knock on WordPress&#8217; door anytime soon. Johnston lists four things contenders must do in order to dethrone WordPress.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Focus on marketing to developers</li>\n<li>Offer a migration path</li>\n<li>Offer hosted and self hosted options</li>\n<li>Build up a community</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The four steps he lists are a good start, but it&#8217;s going to take a lot more than that to take a chunk out of WordPress&#8217; market share. In 2009, I <a title="http://wptavern.com/six-ways-in-which-wordpress-could-die" href="http://wptavern.com/six-ways-in-which-wordpress-could-die">outlined six ways</a> WordPress could die and named <a title="http://www.habariproject.org/en/" href="http://www.habariproject.org/en/">Habari</a> as a viable competitor. Five years later, WordPress is bigger than ever and no one seems to remember the Habari project.</p>\n<h2>A Combination of Factors</h2>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think any <em>one thing</em> will put WordPress in second place. Instead, a combination of factors would likely need to take place. In no particular order, here are a couple of things that might lead to the project&#8217;s demise.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Project leadership routinely ignores the majority.</li>\n<li>It becomes a large, bloated, legacy project that blocks innovation.</li>\n<li>A competing CMS comes along that does everything WordPress does, except better.</li>\n<li>The community in mass disappears or loses interest in favor of a competing product.</li>\n<li>A huge scandal takes place involving Automattic, the WordPress Foundation and those close to the project.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I doubt any of these things will happen and WordPress will continue to be the market leader for at least the next 10 years.

Roots has appealed mainly to developers, because it incorporates modern build tools into its workflow. The theme  was first released in 2011 and now counts more than 70 contributors to the project.</p>\n<p>Roots currently utilizes HTML5 Boilerplate, Bootstrap, Grunt, and Bower in the starter theme but will will soon be moving to Gulp. The project&#8217;s GitHub repo has a <a href="https://github.com/roots/roots/pull/1138" target="_blank">Gulp branch</a> with the relevant discussion and commits.</p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;Gulp is faster, has nicer configuration files, allows us to easily compile both Less and Sass to the same stylesheet, and more,&#8221;</strong> Roots creator <a href="http://benword.com/" target="_blank">Ben Word</a> said, regarding the upcoming changes.</p>\n<p>This will also include an update to Roots&#8217; asset pipeline, which will allow theme developers to take CSS and JS from WordPress plugins and have it compiled into the single CSS and single JS files that the theme builds. The <a href="https://github.com/roots/roots/pull/1215" target="_blank">new asset pipeline</a> brings changes to project folders, removes differences between dev and production tasks, and adds a JSON-based asset pipeline.</p>\n<h3>Build a Roots-based Theme Using Any Framework</h3>\n<p>Additionally, the starter theme will be moving away from including <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> in order to become framework agnostic. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to have a Yeoman generator that will allow you to build a Roots based theme however you want,&#8221; Word said. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be able to pick from any framework, Bootstrap, Bootstrap Sass, Foundation, and more.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While Bootstrap still has a very large user base, the Roots community has shown more interest in other frameworks such as <a href="http://semantic-ui.com/" target="_blank">Semantic UI</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/starter-kit/" target="_blank">Google&#8217;s Web Starter Kit</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A lot of people over the years have expressed that they like Roots, but don’t like Bootstrap,&#8221; Word explained. &#8220;We&#8217;ve even seen some forks pop up (Roots Foundation, for instance) to accommodate other frameworks. By becoming framework agnostic, the starter theme should be able to appeal to a wider audience.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Word and his team plan to have the generator ready for the public in the first quarter of 2015 and are currently working to incorporate work from other Yeoman generators.</p>\n<p>Last year, the Roots community introduced <a href="http://roots.io/wordpress-stack/" target="_blank">Bedrock</a>, a modern WordPress stack that uses Composer for managing WordPress along with Capistrano for deployment. Bedrock can be used with any theme. Since its launch, the project has struggled with branding issues. When all the new changes are merged into Roots&#8217; master branch, Word plans to rename the starter theme and keep Roots as the organization name.</p>\n<p>The Roots starter theme has always had a somewhat narrow audience due to the fact that it has a steeper learning curve than other starter themes. Making the change to be platform agnostic should open it up for more theme developers, but it will continue to cater primarily to those who are interested in using build scripts.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Roots has been at a point where you can’t use it if you’re not using npm, Bower, and Grunt, and we&#8217;ve completely stopped supporting users who don’t want to adapt to the better workflow we’ve created,&#8221; Word said. &#8220;I struggled in the past with choosing to support the average Joe WordPress developer or to push for WordPress devs to learn tools that make them better at their job. Workflow efficiency is definitely the ultimate goal.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 05 Dec 2014 18:06:59 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:57:"WPTavern: nRelate Will Shutdown Its Service December 31st";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=34995";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:67:"http://wptavern.com/nrelate-will-shutdown-its-service-december-31st";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3942:"<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/QikShutdownFeaturedImage.png" rel="prettyphoto[34995]"><img class="size-full wp-image-19708" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/QikShutdownFeaturedImage.png?resize=639%2C200" alt="Qik Shuts Down Featured Image" /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/slimjim/2772087916/">slimmer_jimmer</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/">cc</a>\n<p>The content recommendation service <a title="http://nrelate.com" href="http://nrelate.com">nRelate</a>, <a title="http://nrelate.com/content/2014/12/01/farewell/" href="http://nrelate.com/content/2014/12/01/farewell/">announced</a> it will shut down its service December 31st.

For several years, I used YARPP on WP Tavern to handle related posts and it performed flawlessly. However, at one point, it gave me performance problems because of the resources used on a shared webhosting server. The webhosting provider at the time pointed out that YARPP was taking up too many resources on the server. If you have a limited amount of posts or a beefy server, YARPP is a great alternative because it offers a variety of ways to display related posts.</p>\n<p>After encountering performance problems, I decided to go without related posts. <a title="http://wptavern.com/jetpack-2-9-introduces-multisite-support-and-related-posts-module" href="http://wptavern.com/jetpack-2-9-introduces-multisite-support-and-related-posts-module">Jetpack 2.9</a> released in early 2014, contained a new module called <a title="http://jetpack.me/support/related-posts/" href="http://jetpack.me/support/related-posts/">related posts</a>. Unlike YARPP, all of the processing and server resources were used on Automattic&#8217;s servers instead of my own and eliminated my performance issues with related posts. Keep in mind that when you use the Jetpack Related Posts module, the content is mirrored on WordPress.com for indexing and processing.</p>\n<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that the module will use the featured image attached to a post in the module. If a featured image is not detected, it uses the first image in the post which may or may not be optimal. You might also see a mix of related posts with and without images.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/JetpackRelatedPostsWithoutAnImage.png" rel="prettyphoto[34995]"><img class="size-full wp-image-34999" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/JetpackRelatedPostsWithoutAnImage.png?resize=679%2C266" alt="Related Post Without an Image" /></a>Related Post Without an Image\n<p>I&#8217;m of the mindset that if you can offload the processing required to determine post relationships, then do it. We&#8217;ve used the Jetpack Related Posts module on the Tavern for some time and haven&#8217;t experienced any issues. It&#8217;s also pretty good at being somewhat relevant.

The minimalist, blog-focused theme has so far been well received and users are already eagerly testing it out.</p>\n<p>WordPress developer <a href="https://github.com/chrismccoy" target="_blank">Chris McCoy</a> has created a Twenty Fifteen child theme with a unique twist. At first glance, <a href="https://github.com/chrismccoy/fivebeers" target="_blank">Five Beers</a> appears to be a colorless variation of the default theme, but under the hood you&#8217;ll find a set of powerful AJAX additions.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/five-beers.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[34677]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/five-beers.jpg?resize=971%2C468" alt="five-beers" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34711" /></a></p>\n<p>One of the most impressive features is the way Five Beers handles media display. It incorporates the <a href="http://stripjs.com/" target="_blank">Strip.js</a> lightbox to slide images and videos out from the side of the page. You can see a live example of it on the <a href="http://fivebeers.net/" target="_blank">Five Beers demo site</a>.</p>\n<p>The child theme includes all of the customization options of Twenty Fifteen plus several extra features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AJAX Live Search (still working out the bugs)</li>\n<li>AJAX comments</li>\n<li>AJAX archives</li>\n<li>AJAX A-Z Alphabet post loading</li>\n<li>AJAX infinite scrolling with SEO as a factor</li>\n<li>Custom tag page listed by letter</li>\n<li>Lightbox to adapt to galleries and video oEmbeds</li>\n<li>Unlimited widget area creation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, when you publish a YouTube or Vimeo link, the theme will use the cover image (click to play) as the featured image. If no featured image is set, Five Beers will use a default click to play thumbnail.</p>\n<p>Building all of this functionality into the theme is a bit unorthodox, as most theme authors would opt to put these items into separate plugins. I asked McCoy why he opted to do it this way. &#8220;I’m trying to keep all functionality as the theme, because I prefer not to use a plugin if I don’t need to,&#8221; he said. If you use the theme, you could opt to use McCoy&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/chrismccoy/strip" target="_blank">Strip Lightbox plugin</a> instead and then simply remove the include in the functions file for the lightbox.php file.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, it&#8217;s a theme McCoy built for himself one night while having five different brands of beer, hence the unique name. I&#8217;d like to see each piece of functionality pulled out and supported as a separate plugin, but this isn&#8217;t something he intends to do. McCoy originally planned to create it just for himself but will be adding more features next week.</p>\n<p>This child theme is particularly useful if you want to highlight your archived content by including alphabetical sorting and live search, making it easy for users to discover content as they are typing.</p>\n<p>Five Beers currently requires WordPress 4.1 Beta 1+ to use until 4.1 is officially released. The WordPress 4.1 project schedule has the release targeted for the week of December 8. McCoy does not plan to add the theme to WordPress.org, as the <a href="http://stripjs.com/license" target="_blank">Strip.js licensing</a> is not supported in the official directory.  You can download the Five Beers theme for free on <a href="https://github.com/chrismccoy/fivebeers" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 04 Dec 2014 22:48:27 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:67:"WPTavern: How to Find the Number of Feedly Subscribers to Your Blog";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=34466";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"http://wptavern.com/how-to-find-the-number-of-feedly-subscribers-to-your-blog";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5050:"<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/feedly.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[34466]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/feedly.jpg?resize=1025%2C443" alt="feedly" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34964" /></a></p>\n<p>When Google Reader was laid to rest on July 1, 2013, many users flocked to <a href="http://feedly.com/" target="_blank">Feedly</a>, one of the most popular alternatives. Even if you don&#8217;t use Feedly, it&#8217;s likely that many of your blog&#8217;s readers do. Therefore, if you want a true picture of the number of your RSS subscribers, digging into Feedly&#8217;s numbers should be part of your research.</p>\n<h3>Find Your Feedly Subscriber Count on Mobile</h3>\n<p>Feedly&#8217;s UI is notorious for being less than intuitive and <a href="http://blog.feedly.com/feedly-tutorial-v1/" target="_blank">confusing to navigate</a>. If you poke around, you can find a rough number of your subscribers. If you&#8217;re using a mobile device, simply search for your blog (even if you&#8217;re already subscribed), in the top search bar and it will display a rough count.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/feedly-mobile.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[34466]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/feedly-mobile.jpg?resize=402%2C500" alt="feedly-mobile" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-34933" /></a></p>\n<h3>Find Your Feedly Subscriber Count in the Web App</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for your subscriber count in the web app, click your site in the left sidebar among your subscriptions and then look for your total subscribers under the title.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/feedly-web-app.png" rel="prettyphoto[34466]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/feedly-web-app.png?resize=1025%2C762" alt="feedly-web-app" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34942" /></a></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not too difficult, but what if you want to know the actual count of your Feedly subscribers? After all, there&#8217;s quite a difference between 3,001 and 3,999, especially when you are looking at setting goals. Once you pass 2,000, it seems that Feedly resorts to fuzzy rounding to the nearest thousand instead of reporting actual figures.</p>\n<h3>Feedly Insight Plugin for WordPress</h3>\n<p>WordPress sites can install a plugin called <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/feedly-insight/" target="_blank">Feedly Insight</a> to get an exact subscriber count. It utilizes the <a href="http://developer.feedly.com/" target="_blank">Feedly Cloud API</a> to tap into more exact data about your feed(s). Once you install the plugin, you&#8217;ll notice that it adds its own top level menu where you can click on the &#8220;Feedly Insight&#8221; submenu item. Scroll down to the search bar and enter your URL. It will return a few interesting stats, including languages and an exact subscriber count.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/feedly-insight.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[34466]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/feedly-insight.jpg?resize=828%2C725" alt="feedly-insight" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34953" /></a></p>\n<p>You can also search your competitors&#8217; URLs in order to see how well they&#8217;re doing at attracting subscribers. After performing your research, you can keep the plugin if you want to keep track of your Feedly stats via its dashboard widget, or you can uninstall it and check back again later.</p>\n<p>Having a full picture of RSS subscribers is important for publishers who want to tailor their content to appear better in feed readers. For example, if you find that you have a large number of Feedly subscribers, you will want to make sure that each post appears with an image. Feedly doesn&#8217;t have the ability to fetch your featured image. Instead, it grabs the first image displayed within your post to show as the thumbnail in its reader. If your post has no images, it will show a blank as the thumbnail, which isn&#8217;t ideal. Adding an image to each post will help you to avoid this.</p>\n<p>You can also <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1jmkC6avpJQgdQhuKd2wN0PSYeBzKQ3KQzJEF8F9vZy8/viewform" target="_blank">claim your own Feedly hashtag</a> using this Google form, which allows you to have more control over what people find when they search for your brand or your #name.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a publisher, you cannot ignore Feedly, even if you&#8217;re not a fan of the product. Feed readers are still going strong and Feedly seems to be leading the pack after Google Reader died. If you have never checked to find out how many people are reading your blog through Feedly, you may be surprised. To get a rough idea, just log into the app. The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/feedly-insight/" target="_blank">Feedly Insight</a> plugin offers a more detailed look and an easier way to monitor your stats.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 04 Dec 2014 21:59:43 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:27:"Matt: Performance As Design";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=44539";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"http://ma.tt/2014/12/performance-as-design/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:193:"<p><a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/performance-as-design/">Performance As Design</a>, by Brad Frost.

What if WordPress could recommend plugins based on the ones you have installed? Thanks to a <a title="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30337" href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30337">recent update</a> to the API, users will be able to access a list of recommended plugins in WordPress 4.1.</p>\n<p>The recommendations take into account the plugins you have installed and suggests plugins based on which ones are commonly used together. It&#8217;s similar to an e-commerce shopping cart that recommends products other customers have purchased based on what&#8217;s in the cart.</p>\n<h2>Recommended Plugins To Get its Own Tab</h2>\n<p>In today&#8217;s WordPress 4.1 developer meeting, the group <a title="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/core/p1417641723005178" href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/core/p1417641723005178">reached a consensus</a> to create a new tab for Recommended plugins instead of replacing the Popular tab. I&#8217;m in favor of this decision because they each have a different definition. Also, the Popular tab shows which plugins are doing well across the directory. Another benefit to keeping the Popular plugins tab is for fresh installs of WordPress, as it gives users a good foundation to start looking for plugins.</p>\n<p>In my tests, I noticed that some of the plugins recommended to me are 5-8 years old. I&#8217;ve reported the behavior to Alex Shiels and it will be addressed before 4.1 ships. If you are testing WordPress 4.1 and come across any oddities with plugin recommendations, please <a title="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30337" href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30337">report them</a> in the ticket.</p>\n<p>The Recommended plugins tab exposes new and useful plugins to users instead of limiting them to the Featured and Popular categories. Since recommendations are based on actual data, they should get better as time goes on. Do you think a recommended plugins page is a useful addition to the plugin discovery process?

It is important that if you are going to partner up with someone, the terms and conditions of your partnership relationship are set forth in a written partnership agreement.  A written document promotes clarity and puts partners on notice regarding acceptable partnership conduct.\n\nThe California Corporations Code §§ 16100, 1602 et seq., ("Act") provides rules to determine whether a partnership exists.  If a partnership does exist, it will be governed by both the partnership agreement and the Act.  Under the Act, the partnership agreement is defined as the agreement, whether written, oral, or implied, among partners concerning the partnership, including amendments to the partnership agreement.  The relations among the partners and between the partners and the partnership are governed  by this agreement, whether oral or written.  In addition, the Act will govern the relations among the partners and between the partners and the partnership, to the extent the partnership agreement does not provide otherwise.\n\nWhile the partnership agreement may vary most provisions of the Act, it may not do any of the following (non-exhaustive list):\n\n• Vary the rights and duties under the Corp. Code § 16105 regarding the statement of partnership, except to eliminate the duty to provide copies of statements to all of the partners.\n\n• Unreasonably restrict the right of access to books and records granted by Corp Code § 16403(b) or the right to be furnished with information concerning the partnership\'s business and affairs as granted by Corp Code § 16403(c)\n\n• Eliminate the duty of loyalty under Corp Code §§ 16404(b) and 16603(3), although, if it is not manifestly unreasonable, the partnership agreement may identify types or categories of activities that do not violate the duty of loyalty, and may provide that all of the partners or a specified percentage may authorize or ratify, after full disclosure of all materials facts, a specific act or transaction that otherwise would violate the duty of loyalty.\n\n• Unreasonably reduce the duty of care under corporation code.\n\n• Eliminate the obligation of good faith and fair dealing under the corporation code, but the partnership agreement may prescribe the standards by which the performance of the obligation is to be measured, if the standards are not manifestly unreasonable.\n\nA well-drafted partnership agreement will enable the partners to clarify their respective rights and obligations before the commencement of the partnership business.  This may eliminate ambiguities and areas of doubt that might result in future disputes and controversies.  The existence of an oral joint venture or partnership agreement must be established  by a preponderance of evidence.  Thus, where the agreement is not in writing, the intention of the parties must be determined from their language and conduct, and <em>misunderstandings may escalate into litigation</em>.\n\nAs with all other contracts, competency of the parties, consideration, the nature of the agreement, and a meeting of the minds are elements necessary of the validity of a partnership agreement.  A partnership agreement must be free from fraud.  Where a party has been induced to enter into a partnership by the fraudulent representations of a copartner, the agreement may be rescinded.  Similarly, the agreement must not have as its object an illegal purpose or be contrary to public policy if it is to be enforced.\n\nA partnership being drafted with respect to a specific enterprise should include provisions reflecting the type of business engaged in and the particular circumstances that may be unique  to that partnership.\n\nThat\'s all for now on partnership written agreements.  Stay tuned until next week when we will discuss certain types of partnerships - general, limited, etc.\n<p style="margin-left: -150px; padding-left: 151px; padding-right: 151px; font-size: 14px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.25em;">For more information on the matter, please contact the Law Offices of Omar S.

Code § 16202, or a comparable law of another jurisdiction. The term “persons” is used in the Act to mean an individual, corporation, business trust, estate, trust, partnership, LLC, LP, LLP, association, joint venture, government, government subdivision, or any other legal or commercial entity. [Corp. Code § 16101(9)]\n\nA “business” includes every trade, occupation and profession. [Corp. Code § 16101(1)]\n\n<strong> General Partner\'s Duties</strong>\n\nPartners owe fiduciary duties such as:\n<ul>\n	<li>Duty      of Loyalty - refrain from dealing with a party whose interest is adverse      to the interest of the partnership and refrain from competing with the      partnership for personal gain</li>\n	<li>Duty      of Care – refrain from engaging in negligent or reckless conduct</li>\n	<li>Duty      to act in good faith and fair dealing</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Liabilities of a Partnership</strong>\n\nEach general partner is deemed an agent of the partnership and has the authority to bind the partnership to an agreement with a third party. [Corp. Code § 16301(1)]\n\nThe partnership is also liable for any loss or injury caused to a person by the conduct of a partner acting in the ordinary course of business of the partnership. [Corp. Code § 16305(a)]\n\n<strong>Liabilities of Partners</strong>\n\nAll general partners are jointly and severally liable for all partnership obligations unless otherwise agreed to. 16306(a) In a limited partnership, there is a general partner responsible for partnership obligations, and a limited partner responsible to the extent of his/her ownership interest in the partnership.\n\nA person admitted to an existing partnership is not responsible for obligations existing prior to his admission. 16306(b)\n\nIf a general partner represents himself as a partner of an existing partnership to a third party, he is also personally liable to that party.\n\nThat\'s all for today.  We\'ll talk more partnerships in the foreseeable future.

(22, 2, '2010-06-07 17:21:01', '2010-06-08 00:21:01', 'Today we will be talking California corporations and, specifically, closely held corporations and important documents like a voting agreement, shareholder agreement, and buy-sell agreement.  These documents are critical to shareholders and their involvement with closely held corporations, sometimes referred to as S Corps.  This blog entry will not discuss a corporation\'s by-laws.  You should contact an attorney for more information on by-laws.\n\nVOTING AGREEMENTS\n\nThe shareholders of a corporation may want to allocate control of the corporation in a way that is disproportionate to the ownership of shares of the corporation. Toward that end, they may want to ensure that their shares will be voted in a certain way. For example, they may want to vote their shares for specified persons as directors, vote as a majority of shareholders in the group may decide, or vote to effect a particular corporate policy. Common devices to accomplish these purposes are (1) voting agreements (or pooling agreements), in which the shareholders agree to vote their shares as provided in a voting agreement, and (2) voting trusts, in which legal title to the shares is transferred to a trustee, to be voted as provided in a trust agreement.\n\n<strong> </strong>\n\n<strong> </strong>Voting agreements may be used in a close corporation to permit the shareholders to control the management of the corporation. Several management alternatives to voting agreements and voting trusts exist. These include a close corporation shareholder agreement; or a provision in the corporation’s articles of incorporation for super-majority votes by the corporation’s directors or shareholders on various matters.  In addition, a corporation’s capital structure can be designed to give some shareholders control that is disproportionate to their dollar investment, either by providing for voting and nonvoting shares or shares with special voting rights. This result can also be obtained by issuing debt securities for a portion of the corporation’s initial financing, instead of issuing voting shares for that financing.  A group of majority shareholders in a close corporation can also use a holding company, instead of a shareholder’s voting agreement or voting trust, to consolidate their voting power. Further, shareholders may sometimes find it useful to create a partnership to hold their shares, or, on rare occasions, to cause the corporation to issue stock to several persons to be held jointly.\n\nA voting agreement differs from a shareholder agreement in three significant respects. First, the use of a voting agreement is not limited to shareholders of a close corporation, as is a shareholder agreement.  Second, a voting agreement may be among less than all of the shareholders. Third, a voting agreement covers only the exercise of shareholder voting rights and does not change the role of the shareholders with respect to the directors. Thus, if the shareholders of a close corporation want to enter into an agreement that extends beyond how their shares will be voted, and controls functions that are traditionally within the realm of the directors (for example, appointing officers and setting corporate policies), a shareholder agreement, not a voting agreement, should be used.\n\nSHAREHOLDER AGREEMENTS\n\nA shareholder agreement is a written agreement among all of the shareholders of a statutory close corporation [<em>see </em>Corp. Code § 158 (“close corporation” requires provision in articles limiting shareholders to 35 and specifically identifying corporation as a close corporation)] relating to the affairs and management of the corporation.  If the close corporation has only one shareholder, the shareholder agreement is between the shareholder and the corporation.\n\nThe General Corporation Law [Corp. Code § 300(b)] provides that no shareholder agreement that relates to any phase of the corporation’s affairs will be invalid as between the parties to it on any of the following grounds:\n\n•            It relates to the conduct of the affairs of the corporation so as to interfere with the discretion of the directors;\n\n•            It is an attempt to treat the corporation as if it were a partnership; or\n\n•            It is an attempt to arrange relationships among the shareholders in a manner that would be appropriate only between partners.\n\nThus, in practice, a shareholder agreement permits shareholders to do the following:\n\n•            Manage the close corporation informally, according to the provisions of the agreement, without observing corporate formalities related to director and shareholder meetings; and\n\n•            Make decisions in areas usually reserved for the board of directors, such as dividend policy, distribution of assets on liquidation, selection of officers, and determination of their compensation and tenure\n\nUnless otherwise provided in the shareholder agreement, the agreement may not be modified, extended, or revoked by less than unanimous agreement of the parties. A shareholder agreement terminates when the corporation ceases to be a close corporation, or on the original issuance of shares by the Corporation to a new shareholder who does not become a party to the agreement, unless the agreement provides that it will continue to the extent it is enforceable apart from Corp. Code § 300(b).\n\nShareholders in close corporations frequently want to manage the corporation in a partnership-like manner, determining among themselves who will manage the corporation’s business and how that management will be exercised, while retaining the limitation on personal liability and the other benefits of the corporation form. An important objective in many shareholder agreements is to protect a minority shareholder from the majority’s power by giving the minority shareholder a voice in the corporation’s management, either as a member of the board of directors or otherwise. Other shareholder agreements protect shareholder-employees by ensuring continued employment, and protect shareholder-investors by assuring a specified return of capital through dividends. A shareholder agreement may provide a mechanism requiring the corporation to buy back a shareholder’s shares on the occurrence of certain events such as the shareholder’s death, disability or termination of employment. The price for the buy back can be determined by a formula set forth in the shareholder agreement.\n\nBUY-SELL AGREEMENTS\n\nA buy-sell agreement (also known as a buyout agreement) is a contract, particularly important in the case of a close or closely held corporation, under which the shareholders or owners of a business agree to purchase the interests of a withdrawing or deceased shareholder [Black’s Law Dictionary (5<sup>th</sup> ed. 1979). At 181]. The agreement describes the conditions (usually death, disability, or termination of employment) and the terms under which shareholders may or must transfer their shares [Black’s Law Dictionary (5<sup>th</sup> ed. 1979, at 181].\n\nA buy-sell agreement is merely an executory contract to buy and sell personal property (that is, an employee’s shares) if and when a particular event such as termination of employment occurs. A shareholder under such an executory contract is entitled to the benefits of ownership until delivery is made or tendered to the buyer, unless the buy-sell agreement specifies or implies a different intention.\n\nGenerally, a buy-sell agreement provides the corporation and the shareholders with the certainty of a legally binding transfer plan well in advance of the actual events, facilitating agreement on the terms and manner of transfer. It ensures the uninterrupted continuation of the business entity in the event of the death or withdrawal of a participant, prevents “outsiders” from becoming transferees of corporate shares upon a shareholder’s death, disability, or retirement from the corporation, and enables the shareholders to sell their shares for a fair price despite the lack of a public market.  Further, if the agreement is properly shareholder’s interest in the corporation, and ensures that his or her estate will receive the liquid assets it may need for taxes, creditor’s claims, or probate expenses. An agreement may also give the remaining shareholders an option to dissolve the corporation upon the death of a major shareholder.\n\nI hope this was a good summary of important shareholder documents for California corporations. That’s all for today.\n\nFor more information on the matter, please contact the Law Offices of Omar S.

(71, 2, '2011-10-25 11:01:43', '2011-10-25 18:01:43', 'Lost In Translation\n\nBy: Omar S. Anorga\n\nA bilingual or multilingual attorney can be a valuable resource to your law firm.  I have found that communicating with potential clients in their native Spanish language immediately promotes in them a sense of trust, comfort and confidence in my legal abilities.\n\nNot only do language skills enhance the attorney-client relationship, but it also allows the attorney to increase his or her market-share by carving out a legal niche with a certain language-speaking community.  Additionally, the globalizing economy is making it imperative for California attorneys to be able to communicate with individuals from all over the world, especially those in the Asian financial markets.  More locally, Spanish is by far the most widely spoken language in California, other than English.  Without a doubt, California attorneys are, indeed, leaving money on the table if they cannot communicate with potential clients in a language other than English.\n\nYou probably already knew or suspected that  state law requires certain fee agreements be translated from English into a different language. If you did, great – you are ahead of the curve.  If not, let’s briefly review the requirements of Civil Code Section1632 et seq. before you sign up that next well-healed foreign speaking client.\n\nCivil Code Section 1632 (b)(6) states that any attorney who negotiates legal services primarily in Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, or Korean, shall deliver to his or her potential client, a written translation of the fee agreement in the language in which it was negotiated prior to the execution thereof.  Say an exclusively Spanish speaking potential client walks through your door seeking legal representation.  During the client in-take, you and the potential client agree to the terms of the fee agreement.  You present the potential client with your tried and true English written fee agreement, which the client signs. Now your firm has a valuable new matter.  Under most circumstances, congratulations are in order; however, you have just violated Civil Code Section 1632, and potentially exposed yourself to a malpractice lawsuit affording the client the right to rescind the fee agreement.  Not good.\n\nI know what you are thinking, there has to be away around the requirements of Section 1632 (b)(6) so that you do not have to translate your reliable English fee agreement, right? And there is, but be careful of the scope of Civil Code Section 1632 (h), which provides an exception to the translation requirement if your client negotiates the terms of the fee agreement through his or her own interpreter, defined as a “person, not a minor, able to speak fluently and read with full understanding both the English language and any other languages in which the fee agreement was negotiated, and who is not employed” by you.  So, your assistant who is fluid in Chinese or Korean or any other of the covered languages will not be able to assist you with interpretation, and, thus, circumvent the translation requirement.\n\nIf the above-mentioned exception is not in play, your next move is to have your fee agreement translated into the language in which it was negotiated.  Here are a couple of tips to keep in mind:\n\nFirst, the most cost-effective way to translate a written fee agreement is by plugging into Google Translate, which is a free online resource that translates content in several other languages (except for Tagalog).  I recently cut and pasted my eight-page fee agreement into Google Translate, and I was astonished at how remarkably accurate Google translated my English fee agreement into Spanish.  There were minor issues with the translation, but I was able to rectify them without any problem.\n\nThere were some issues with Google Translate\'s word choices. For example, my English fee agreement collectively refers to me as an attorney; presumably, the common translation of that word should have been abogado. Google Translate, for some reason, used the word fiscal, which means district attorney or prosecutor.  This word choice problem is a likely specific to the Spanish language, which is the official language of 21 countries, each having their own nuanced dialect.\n\nGoogle Translate is probably best for those attorneys with a decent grasp of one of the covered languages under Civil Code Section 1632.  With some moderate editing, the attorney should be able to easily present the potential client with a properly worded and translated fee agreement.\n\nSecond, there is a thriving market dedicated to translating professional documents.  A simple online search for these types of services will bring up several different providers.  Legal document translation generally costs in between 14 to 26 cents per word, depending on the language.  Chinese and Spanish tend to be on the lower end of cost, while Korean and Vietnamese are middle of the road, and Tagalog being the most expensive.  Also, note that translating English into these languages can either expand or contract text.  Generally, all romantic languages, like Spanish, expand the text from an English translation.  This is also true for Vietnamese, but not necessarily so for Korean.  It varies with Chinese and Tagalog.\n\nWhen selecting a company to translate your fee agreement, determine whether it is an accepted member of the American Translators Association, which establishes a high standard of translating competency.  Also, make sure to determine if someone other than the translator will review your document for accuracy. Two sets of eyes are better than one.\n\nSo for all you talented linguistic attorneys seeking to build your practice with non-English speaking clients, or for those attorneys who already are, make sure to comply with the requirements of Civil Code Section 1632, et seq., and have your fee agreement translated into the language in which it was negotiated.  Because after you have obtained that favorable result for your client and its time for them to pay up, you do not want anything to suddenly get lost in translation.\n\nOmar S.

(78, 2, '2011-11-08 18:22:13', '2011-11-09 01:22:13', 'I recently wrote an article for the Daily Journal entitled <em>Lost In Translation: non-English Fee Agreements</em>.  The article focused in on California Civil Code ¶ 1632(b)(6), which requires attorneys to translate their fee agreements (i.e., the contract between the attorney and client) if it was negotiated in either Spanish, Korean, Vietnamese, Tagalog, and Chinese.\n\nI understand that the article might have little interest if you’re not an attorney, or a potential client seeking to hire an attorney who speaks one of the languages mentioned above.  However, a closer examination of Civil Code ¶ 1632 reveals that the breadth of this law potentially affects a large part of our population.  Let me explain.\n\nSection 1632(b)(2) states that the law applies to a “loan or extension of credit secured other than by real property, or unsecured, for use primarily for personal, family or\n\nhousehold purposes.”  The likely application of this law significantly affects foreign speaking individuals seeking, among other things, a credit card or a car loan.\n\nIt is not uncommon to hear stories of Latino immigrants financing the purchase of a motor vehicle in Spanish only to sign a one-sided, inconspicous dealership agreement that is written in English.  Some unscrupulous dealerships prey on the unknowing by inserting terms in the English written agreement when there was no meeting of the minds as to these terms.  I am sure these types of illegal practices occur in the Korean, Chinese, Tagalog, and Vietnamese communities, too.\n\nSection 1632(b)(3) states that the law also applies to “a lease, sublease, rental contract or agreement, or other term of tenancy contract or agreement, for a period of longer than one month, covering a dwelling, an apartment, or mobilehome, or other dwelling unit normally occupied as a residence.”  This portion of the law has a tremendous affect on renters, landlords and real estate agents.  Let’s look at how this could play out in everyday life.\n\nYou, Korean speaking landlord, own an apartment building in Los Angeles County.  You negotiated a rental agreement for one of your units.  The renter and you did all the negotiating in Korean; however, you presented the renter with an English rental agreement.  In this scenario, you, landlord, should be happy, right? Wrong.  You have just violated the law, and given the renter an opportunity to rescind an agreement that was going to generate some honest to goodness rental income.\n\nThe remaining provisions of Civil Code ¶ 1632 protect against brokers facilitating reverse mortgage transaction, and conventional mortgages if they were negotiated in one of the languages mentioned herein.  Brokers, along with landlords, car dealerships, etc., should be careful to either provide the relevant documents central to the transaction in the translated language, or get around doing so by taking advantage of the exception set forth in Civil Code ¶ 1632(h), which provides, in pertinent part, that if the consumer/renter/legal client has his or her own translator over the age of 18, there is no requirement that the relevant documents be translated.\n\nAs you can see, Civil Code ¶ 1632 et seq., is a law, along with many others (Civil Code ¶ 2944.6 – translated loan modification documents), intended to protect foreign speaking consumers/renters/legal clients from entering into agreements that were not translated in the language that they were negotiated in.  However, it is completely short-sighted to think the law is a one-way street, and that it only protects consumers/renters/legal clients. No, it goes beyond to also protect business owners, landlords, attorneys, brokers, and financing companies from entering into agreements that can later be rescinded if they were not properly translated.\n\nSometimes certain written agreements have to be translated into specific languages.  If you or someone you know is seeking to enter into one of the transactions we have discussed, or someone who is seeking to get out of one of these transactions, please do not hesitate to call my office to discuss your legal options.', 'Sometimes, It Just Has to Be in Your Language.', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'sometimes-it-just-has-to-be-in-your-language', '', '', '2014-11-05 17:51:18', '2014-11-05 17:51:18', '', 0, 'http://anorgalaw.com/blog/?p=78', 0, 'post', '', 0),

(85, 2, '2012-07-09 13:10:44', '2012-07-09 20:10:44', '\r\n<p>Here are some HR tips for the small business owner –</p>\r\n<p>JOB APPLICATIONS – Many employers do not require prospective employees to submit a job application but instead rely on a person’s resume. While resumes can be helpful, they should be used in conjunction with an application. A well-drafted application will elicit useful factual data, and it can also protect an employer by, for example, including an agreement that requires arbitration of all employment related disputes, or also highlight and bring to the prospective employee’s attention, that he or she will be an at-will employment.</p>\r\n<p>EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK – Having a current, legally compliant employee handbook is a must. A good handbook contains the “rules of engagement”-what the employer expects from its employees and what they can expect from it. Without a handbook, it is difficult to prove a given policy was in place and understood by your professionals and staff members.</p>\r\n<p>INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS – Uncertainty over whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor can pose substantial liability for employers. The money you save on the front end will never earn you enough interest to pay what you will owe on the back end. Oh, and you will pay.</p>\r\n<p>PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS – In a busy work environment, it is not at all uncommon for employee evaluations to fall by the wayside entirely. But employers that don’t conduct regular performance reviews may have difficulty terminating problem employees-especially when there’s a lack of notice regarding problems.</p>\r\n<p>EXIT INTERVIEWS – If an employer chooses to conduct exit interviews, they should be done every time someone leaves the business. These interviews can be used to help defend a lawsuit if a disgruntled employee decides to sue. For example, if a departing employee signs an exit interview summary indicating everything was fine, it will be difficult to later contend things were amiss.</p>\r\n<p>TERMINATION – A poorly administered employment termination with little or no documentation can present a serious problem for employers who later seek to show that the action was justified by legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons. Always document the reasons for termination</p>\r\n<p>Abiding by these rather straightforward suggestions will ensure that your business, from an HR perspective, operates efficiently, but also help minimize the possibility of legal claims from disgruntled employees.</p>\r\n', 'Some HR TIPS', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'some-hr-tips', '', '', '2014-11-05 17:51:17', '2014-11-05 17:51:17', '', 0, 'http://anorgalaw.com/blog/?p=85', 0, 'post', '', 0),

There are several definitions of a trademark, but I like this one: “A <em>trademark </em>is a word, name, symbol, device, or any combination thereof used to identify and distinguish a good.”  So, think about your favorite soft drink.  For some its, COKE, and for others, its PEPSI.  I tend to like SQUIRT over both of these sodas.  Nevertheless, the point, however, is that each of these soft drinks are prime examples of words being used to describe a tangible good that is different from similar tangible goods.</p>\r\n<p>More often than not, people innocently and mistakenly use the word trademark interchangeably with other types of marks – like, a <em>service mark</em>, which is a mark used to describe and identify the source of a service – like JIFFY LUBE or ROTOR ROOTER, which provide services, and NOT tangible goods.  Other examples of “trademarks” include,  a <em>certification mark</em> – think ENERGY STAR as seen on certain appliances; or a <em>collective mark</em> – think GIRLS SCOUTS or CPAs.  And, sometimes <em>slogans, shapes, or colors</em> get “trademark” protection.  So, think of Nike’s Just Do It slogan, or the shape of Coke’s glass soda bottle, or McDonald’s use of the colors red and yellow in their restaurants.</p>\r\n<p>A quick commercial break – for brevity purposes, we will continue to use the word trademark to describe the different marks mentioned above even though you should know that the using the word trademark, in some instances, might not be technically correct.</p>\r\n<p>Technicalities aside, an underlining issue for all these trademarks, is usage.</p>\r\n<p>Protection of trademarks depends upon, and begins with, actual use of the mark in commerce. Trademark protection is available under the common law from the time that the owner begins to use the trademark in commerce.  However, further protection may be obtained by federally registering the trademark; the fact remains – you get NO protection if you are NOT using the trademark.</p>\r\n<p>The federal registration process is rather straightforward.  Let’s briefly discuss the process of getting your trademark registered through the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), which is responsible for the federal registration of trademarks.</p>\r\n<p>When an application is received, the PTO reviews it to determine if it meets the minimum requirements for receiving a filing date. If the application meets the filing requirements, the PTO assigns it a serial number and sends the applicant a receipt about two months after filing.  About four months after filing, an examining attorney at the PTO reviews the application and determines whether the mark may be registered.  The examiner will reject an application for several reasons; however, a common ground for refusal is likelihood of confusion between the applicant’s trademark and existing registered trademark.</p>\r\n<p>If the application is not rejected, then the examiner will approve the trademark for publication in the Official Gazette, a weekly publication of the PTO.  If there is no opposition to the publication, the trademark will finally be considered registered, and the examining attorney will issue a certificate of registration.</p>\r\n<p>Indeed, getting your trademark federally registered is beneficial for several reasons, however, the primary reason to do so is that your trademark will have nation-wide trademark protection.  As opposed to using your trademark without registration, which will limit your trademark protection to your geographical area.  So, your exterminating business with the name Vamanos Pest would more than likely only have trademark protection in your city, maybe county.  It is highly unlikely, in a big state like California, for example, that you could prevent someone in San Francisco from using your trademark, Vamanos Pest, if you are operating the same in San Diego.</p>\r\n<p>As you can imagine, there is a lot more to trademarks than what we have discussed herein.  I only have so much space.  Nevertheless, you should walk away knowing that: 1) trademarks vary in type; 2) you have to use them in commerce; and 3) it’s probably best that you have them federally registered.  If you have any questions regarding trademarks, or if you would like to have a trademark registered, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>\r\n', 'Trademark - What is it?', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'trademark-what-is-it', '', '', '2014-11-05 17:51:17', '2014-11-05 17:51:17', '', 0, 'http://anorgalaw.com/blog/?p=94', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Instead, the harm done is to intangible assets, such as economic interests or business relationships.\n\n<strong>Fraudulent Misrepresentation</strong>\n\nFraudulent misrepresentation, known also as fraud or deceit, protects economic interests and the right to fair and honest treatment. For a fraud claim, a plaintiff must establish that the defendant intentionally misrepresented a material fact and the plaintiff relied on and was harmed by the misrepresentation. For example, if a business submits materially misleading financial statements to a bank in an attempt to secure a loan and the bank, relying on such statements, lends money to the business, the bank will have a fraud claim against the business if the business later defaults on the loan. A fraud claim may also arise from the failure to disclose a material fact if a defendant owed a duty to speak on account of a special relationship. For example, a financial advisor representing both a buyer and seller of real property may be liable for fraud if he knows that the property contains toxic chemicals and fails to tell this to the buyer.\n\n<strong>Interference with Contractual Relations</strong>\n\nThe tort of interference with contractual relations permits a plaintiff to recover damages based upon a claim that a defendant interfered with the plaintiff\'s contractual relations. The elements of an intentional interference with contractual relations claim are (1) a valid contract between plaintiff and a third party; (2) defendant\'s knowledge of this contract; (3) defendant\'s intentional acts designed to induce a breach or disruption of the contractual relationship; (4) actual breach or disruption of the contractual relationship; and (5) resulting damage.\n\nTo be considered tortious, a defendant\'s actions must substantially exceed fair competition and free expression, such as persuading a bank not to lend a competitor any more money.\n\n<strong>Interference with Prospective Business Advantage</strong>\n\nThe tort of interference with prospective business advantage protects economic interests that have not yet been formalized into contract. The elements of that tort are (1) an economic relationship between the plaintiff and some third person containing the probability of future economic benefit to the plaintiff, (2) defendant\'s knowledge of the existence of the relationship, (3) defendant\'s intentional acts designed to disrupt the relationship, (4) actual disruption of the relationship, and (5) damages to the plaintiff proximately caused by the acts of the defendant.\n\n<strong>Unfair Competition</strong>\n\nIn <a href="http://www.inc.com/topic/California">California</a>, the tort of unfair competition includes "any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising."

Persuade your neighbors to compromise whenever you can.  Point out to them how the nominal winner is often a real loser – in fees, expenses and waste of time.”</em> Abraham Lincoln. (Italicize added.)  If you can settle a matter early and without incident, do it.  If not, look at what you potentially could endure:\n\n•            Emotional Impact – Even the bickering in a minor dispute can be costly, because it distracts the participants from their primary occupation;\n\n•            Controversies Waste Time – A common feature of litigation the waste of time involved.  Constructive activities must be postponed.  Pleasures and profits are held in abeyance;\n\n•            The High Cost of Litigation – A judge once told me that litigation was only for well-heeled individuals.  Enough said.\n\n•            Your Reputation – Remember that your involvement in a lawsuit, which is a public document, can affect your reputation and your credit rating.  Even the rumor of a pending lawsuit can impair                 your business or future dealings with others.  Can you afford that risk?\n\n<em> Settlement During Litigation</em>\n\nEven the most reasonable and prudent individuals cannot avoid the filing of a lawsuit.  Indeed, sometimes parties, regretfully, feel that they can only receive a better result after the filing of a lawsuit.  Some attorneys call it leverage, and feel that the opposing party and/or their representative will not engage in meaningful settlement discussion until after the filing of a complaint.  This is a judgment call.  Nevertheless, once an individual has decided to boldly venture down the path of litigation, they have signaled to the other side that they are willing to let someone (i.e., a jury or a judge) else decide their fate.  Accordingly, a negotiated settlement after the filing of a lawsuit can benefit you in many ways:\n\n•            Compromise removes the risk of complete loss at trial;\n\n•            A settlement cuts off escalating litigation costs;\n\n•            The settlement process allows the parties to compromise their dispute on a rational basis, thus avoiding the risk that a judge or jury may decide their case with less understanding;\n\n•            A settlement removes the possibility of appeal;\n\n•            Pre-trial settlement removes the risk of witness problems at trial;\n\n•            A settlement can often be paid in installments;\n\n•            No exposure to punitive damages;\n\n•            A settlement precludes a reportable judgment, which is a permanent record; and\n\n•            A settlement eliminates the emotional strain of trial.\n\nIdeally, early settlement of a disagreement would more often than not be in your best interest; however, sometimes that is not possible or not desirable for some individuals.  But, at some point, even after the filing of a lawsuit, you should really consider your exposure in prosecuting or further defending a disagreement, and seriously consider whether or not you would benefit from settlement.  Honest Abe would probably think so.', 'Benefits of Settling a Disagreement ', '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'benefits-of-settling-a-disagreement', '', '', '2014-11-05 17:51:42', '2014-11-05 17:51:42', '', 0, 'http://anorgalaw.com/blog/?p=33', 0, 'post', '', 0),

(184, 2, '2011-07-21 21:45:58', '2011-07-22 04:45:58', 'A California Court of Appeals judge once described the Small Claims Courts (limited to claims of $7,500.00 dollars or less) in our State, as a judicial forum yielding “speedy common sense justice without the need to resort to lawyers.” Indeed, the Small Claims Courts provide several benefits not generally offered by Courts of Limited (claims above $7,500.00 dollars but less than $25,000.00 dollars) and Unlimited (claims above $25,000.00 dollars) jurisdiction.\n\nThose benefits include, but are not limited to, the following:\n<ol>\n	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Quick Resolution</span>– Small Claims matters are generally resolved within two or three months from the date that the Plaintiff (individual initiating the lawsuit) files his or her complaint (document that sets forth the Plaintiff’s claims and request for relief, usually money). This is very different than the filing of a lawsuit in Limited or Unlimited Civil Jurisdiction, which, potentially, can go on for a year or two, sometimes even longer;</li>\n	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Affordable</span> – The cost for the filing of the complaint varies depending on the amount of your claim. Filing fees start at thirty dollars and cap out at seventy-five dollars.  Additionally, attorneys cannot represent litigating parties (Plaintiff or Defendant) in Small Claims court. So, a litigating party can get their day in court without the expense of retaining a lawyer and, thus, making the Small Claims forum even more affordable. Win-win.</li>\n	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Preservation of Judicial Resource</span>s– The courtrooms dealing with Limited and Unlimited Civil matters, especially, in Los Angeles County (the largest trial court system in the United States), are simply swamped with heavy caseloads. In addition, in 2010, the County laid off over three hundred court employees, and implemented a monthly furlough day for an entire year, causing even more delays in resolving these matters.  Simply put, more cases, less courtroom staff and time to handle these matters equals longer periods of time before outcome resolution. As such, Small Claims Courts play a critical role in alleviating Limited and Unlimited courtrooms of matters that can be handled by a judge in a speedy and fair manner.</li>\n</ol>\nAs you can see, the Small Claims Courts provide a tremendous public interest by providing us with an opportunity to resolve our grievances with little expense and delays. However, there are some perils in selecting the Small Claims judicial forum.  Chiefly among these dangers is the selection of the wrong forum.\n\nAs I mentioned above, Small Claims Courts can only handle matters in which litigating parties are seeking $7<ins datetime="2011-06-21T22:05" cite="mailto:raindeo">,</ins>500 dollars or less in damages.  What happens if your matter is worth more than this amount, but you, nevertheless, file in and are successful in obtaining a judgment in Small Claims Court?<ins datetime="2011-06-21T21:56" cite="mailto:raindeo"> </ins>\n\nRegretfully, you are more than likely limited to the amount of your judgment, which can be pretty painful as the example below will demonstrate.\n\nI recently heard of a situation in which a litigating party, who speaks only Spanish and who has no legal background or education, filed a matter in Small Claims Court.  She alleged that a contractor had breached a contract and performed less than workmanlike craftsmanship on her home.  She paid him approximately $80,000.00 dollars to perform the construction, which he did not complete.  She had independent evidence that the work performed was shoddy, below the proper construction standard, and that it would cost her over $100,000.00 dollars to get what she initially bargained for – an acceptable addition to her home.\n\nThe judge ruled in her favor, and entered into a judgment against the contractor in the amount of $7<ins datetime="2011-06-21T21:58" cite="mailto:raindeo">,</ins>500.00 dollars even though she would have more than likely obtained a much, much larger judgment if she would filed in a judicial forum with no limitations on damages.\n\nYou must be wondering why this lady is precluded from re-filing her matter in a different judicial forum for the purpose of obtaining larger damages?  The law in California, and in most states, has a legal concept akin to the old adage – you only get one bite at the proverbial apple.  This concept is called <em>Res Judacata</em>, and this Latin principal stands for preventing the same litigating parties from re-filing their same claims in subsequent litigation.\n\nIn the instant matter, this principal seems rather harsh and unsympathetic to the lady mentioned above; however, you can imagine what would happen if this law was not in place.  Indeed, litigating parties who lost their respective lawsuits, or who did not obtain the damages amount they wanted, would simply go to another court and re-file their lawsuits.\n\nThis ability to go shopping for different courtrooms until you found one that ruled the way you wanted is simply unacceptable, and would be an absolute nightmare for our court system, and the litigating party on the other end of the lawsuit.  He or she would never know if the problem central to the lawsuit would ever go away.  Lawsuits should have a beginning and an end, and <em>Res Judacata</em> make sure that they do.\n\nNext time you have a potential lawsuit, think twice about where is the best judicial forum to file it in.  Also, in some instances, you should consult with an attorney if you are unsure about where you should proceed with your lawsuit.  Remember, the Small Claims Courts can be the right place for you and your lawsuit, or it can be the absolute wrong place, too.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding this article, or questions regarding litigation counseling, please do not hesitate to contact the Law Offices of Omar S.

There are several definitions of a trademark, but I like this one: “A <em>trademark </em>is a word, name, symbol, device, or any combination thereof used to identify and distinguish a good.”  So, think about your favorite soft drink.  For some its, COKE, and for others, its PEPSI.  I tend to like SQUIRT over both of these sodas.  Nevertheless, the point, however, is that each of these soft drinks are prime examples of words being used to describe a tangible good that is different from similar tangible goods.\n\nMore often than not, people innocently and mistakenly use the word trademark interchangeably with other types of marks – like, a <em>service mark</em>, which is a mark used to describe and identify the source of a service – like JIFFY LUBE or ROTOR ROOTER, which provide services, and NOT tangible goods.  Other examples of “trademarks” include,  a <em>certification mark</em> – think ENERGY STAR as seen on certain appliances; or a <em>collective mark</em> – think GIRLS SCOUTS or CPAs.  And, sometimes <em>slogans, shapes, or colors</em> get “trademark” protection.  So, think of Nike’s Just Do It slogan, or the shape of Coke’s glass soda bottle, or McDonald’s use of the colors red and yellow in their restaurants.\n\nA quick commercial break - for brevity purposes, we will continue to use the word trademark to describe the different marks mentioned above even though you should know that the using the word trademark, in some instances, might not be technically correct.\n\nTechnicalities aside, an underlining issue for all these trademarks, is usage.\n\nProtection of trademarks depends upon, and begins with, <span style="text-decoration: underline">actual use of the mark in commerce</span>. Trademark protection is available under the common law from the time that the owner begins to use the trademark in commerce.  However, further protection may be obtained by federally registering the trademark; the fact remains – you get NO protection if you are NOT using the trademark.\n\nThe federal registration process is rather straightforward.  Let’s briefly discuss the process of getting your trademark registered through the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), which is responsible for the federal registration of trademarks.\n\nWhen an application is received, the PTO reviews it to determine if it meets the minimum requirements for receiving a filing date. If the application meets the filing requirements, the PTO assigns it a serial number and sends the applicant a receipt about two months after filing.  About four months after filing, an examining attorney at the PTO reviews the application and determines whether the mark may be registered.  The examiner will reject an application for several reasons; however, a common ground for refusal is likelihood of confusion between the applicant\'s trademark and existing registered trademark.\n\nIf the application is not rejected, then the examiner will approve the trademark for publication in the Official Gazette, a weekly publication of the PTO.  If there is no opposition to the publication, the trademark will finally be considered registered, and the examining attorney will issue a certificate of registration.\n\nIndeed, getting your trademark federally registered is beneficial for several reasons, however, the primary reason to do so is that your trademark will have nation-wide trademark protection.  As opposed to using your trademark without registration, which will limit your trademark protection to your geographical area.  So, your exterminating business with the name Vamanos Pest would more than likely only have trademark protection in your city, maybe county.  It is highly unlikely, in a big state like California, for example, that you could prevent someone in San Francisco from using your trademark, Vamanos Pest, if you are operating the same in San Diego.\n\nAs you can imagine, there is a lot more to trademarks than what we have discussed herein.  I only have so much space.  Nevertheless, you should walk away knowing that: 1) trademarks vary in type; 2) you have to use them in commerce; and 3) it’s probably best that you have them federally registered.  If you have any questions regarding trademarks, or if you would like to have a trademark registered, please do not hesitate to contact us.', 'Trademark - What is it?', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '94-revision', '', '', '2012-09-20 14:00:41', '2012-09-20 21:00:41', '', 94, 'http://anorgalaw.com/94-revision/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

While resumes can be helpful, they should be used in conjunction with an application.  A well-drafted application will elicit useful factual data, and it can also protect an employer by, for example, including an agreement that requires arbitration of all employment related disputes, or also highlight and bring to the prospective employee’s attention, that he or she will be an at-will employment.\n\nEMPLOYEE HANDBOOK – Having a current, legally compliant employee handbook is a must.  A good handbook contains the “rules of engagement”-what the employer expects from its employees and what they can expect from it.  Without a handbook, it is difficult to prove a given policy was in place and understood by your professionals and staff members.\n\nINDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS – Uncertainty over whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor can pose substantial liability for employers.  The money you save on the front end will never earn you enough interest to pay what you will owe on the back end.  Oh, and you will pay.\n\nPERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS – In a busy work environment, it is not at all uncommon for employee evaluations to fall by the wayside entirely.  But employers that don’t conduct regular performance reviews may have difficulty terminating problem employees-especially when there’s a lack of notice regarding problems.\n\nEXIT INTERVIEWS – If an employer chooses to conduct exit interviews, they should be done every time someone leaves the business.  These interviews can be used to help defend a lawsuit if a disgruntled employee decides to sue.  For example, if a departing employee signs an exit interview summary indicating everything was fine, it will be difficult to later contend things were amiss.\n\nTERMINATION – A poorly administered employment termination with little or no documentation can present a serious problem for employers who later seek to show that the action was justified by legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons.  Always document the reasons for termination\n\nAbiding by these rather straightforward suggestions will ensure that your business, from an HR perspective, operates efficiently, but also help minimize the possibility of legal claims from disgruntled employees.\n', 'Some HR TIPS', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '85-revision', '', '', '2012-07-09 13:10:44', '2012-07-09 20:10:44', '', 85, 'http://anorgalaw.com/85-revision/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Julio’s Export and Import, Inc., Case Number: BC469855.  We conducted some investigation revealing that the plaintiff’s once tough exterior, was now to starting to demonstrate some cracks.  The client was pleased that we were able to obtain early resolution of this matter.\n\nIn another matter, I was able to settle a dispute that looked like it was destined for a litigation.  My client, who has authorized this statement, delivered some widgets to a company for them to put a shrink-wrap on said widgets.  This company accepted the widgets, did the work, and returned the widgets to my client; however, a significant amount of the widgets were missing from the order.  My client alleged they were properly delivered, the other-side, obviously, alleged the opposite – so, Houston, we have a problem.  The facts of the matter strongly suggested that the company simply lost the widgets, or dropped the ball somehow, and they knew that but, of course, they could not admit to such a costly mistake.  Nevertheless, I was able to work out a deal where both parties were satisfied with the terms and, mostly, importantly, the business relationship between these two salvaged.\n\n<em>Existing Matters</em> – Co-counsel and I are excited that our failure to pay commissions matter, which was being fought on two different fronts, will be consolidated and, ultimately, litigated in one courtroom up North, in Marin County.  This has been a great experience for me to work side-by-side with co-counsel, Clark Rivera – who is also my legal mentor.  He has a high-octane legal mind, and it’s been a beneficial learning experience for me, to be working on this matter.

Why? Because the resume is the “glam shot” of the employee, and does not always address the specific items of importance to your business.\n\n8. <em>Failing to call and verify references provided by the employee about past employment.</em> Why?

There are several definitions of a trademark, but I like this one: “A <em>trademark </em>is a word, name, symbol, device, or any combination thereof used to identify and distinguish a good.”  So, think about your favorite soft drink.  For some its, COKE, and for others, its PEPSI.  I tend to like SQUIRT over both of these sodas.  Nevertheless, the point, however, is that each of these soft drinks are prime examples of words being used to describe a tangible good that is different from similar tangible goods.</p>\r\n<p>More often than not, people innocently and mistakenly use the word trademark interchangeably with other types of marks – like, a <em>service mark</em>, which is a mark used to describe and identify the source of a service – like JIFFY LUBE or ROTOR ROOTER, which provide services, and NOT tangible goods.  Other examples of “trademarks” include,  a <em>certification mark</em> – think ENERGY STAR as seen on certain appliances; or a <em>collective mark</em> – think GIRLS SCOUTS or CPAs.  And, sometimes <em>slogans, shapes, or colors</em> get “trademark” protection.  So, think of Nike’s Just Do It slogan, or the shape of Coke’s glass soda bottle, or McDonald’s use of the colors red and yellow in their restaurants.</p>\r\n<p>A quick commercial break – for brevity purposes, we will continue to use the word trademark to describe the different marks mentioned above even though you should know that the using the word trademark, in some instances, might not be technically correct.</p>\r\n<p>Technicalities aside, an underlining issue for all these trademarks, is usage.</p>\r\n<p>Protection of trademarks depends upon, and begins with, actual use of the mark in commerce. Trademark protection is available under the common law from the time that the owner begins to use the trademark in commerce.  However, further protection may be obtained by federally registering the trademark; the fact remains – you get NO protection if you are NOT using the trademark.</p>\r\n<p>The federal registration process is rather straightforward.  Let’s briefly discuss the process of getting your trademark registered through the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), which is responsible for the federal registration of trademarks.</p>\r\n<p>When an application is received, the PTO reviews it to determine if it meets the minimum requirements for receiving a filing date. If the application meets the filing requirements, the PTO assigns it a serial number and sends the applicant a receipt about two months after filing.  About four months after filing, an examining attorney at the PTO reviews the application and determines whether the mark may be registered.  The examiner will reject an application for several reasons; however, a common ground for refusal is likelihood of confusion between the applicant’s trademark and existing registered trademark.</p>\r\n<p>If the application is not rejected, then the examiner will approve the trademark for publication in the Official Gazette, a weekly publication of the PTO.  If there is no opposition to the publication, the trademark will finally be considered registered, and the examining attorney will issue a certificate of registration.</p>\r\n<p>Indeed, getting your trademark federally registered is beneficial for several reasons, however, the primary reason to do so is that your trademark will have nation-wide trademark protection.  As opposed to using your trademark without registration, which will limit your trademark protection to your geographical area.  So, your exterminating business with the name Vamanos Pest would more than likely only have trademark protection in your city, maybe county.  It is highly unlikely, in a big state like California, for example, that you could prevent someone in San Francisco from using your trademark, Vamanos Pest, if you are operating the same in San Diego.</p>\r\n<p>As you can imagine, there is a lot more to trademarks than what we have discussed herein.  I only have so much space.  Nevertheless, you should walk away knowing that: 1) trademarks vary in type; 2) you have to use them in commerce; and 3) it’s probably best that you have them federally registered.  If you have any questions regarding trademarks, or if you would like to have a trademark registered, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>\r\n', 'Trademark - What is it?', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '94-revision-3', '', '', '2013-04-24 02:12:13', '2013-04-24 02:12:13', '', 94, 'http://anorgalaw.com/94-revision-3/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

While resumes can be helpful, they should be used in conjunction with an application. A well-drafted application will elicit useful factual data, and it can also protect an employer by, for example, including an agreement that requires arbitration of all employment related disputes, or also highlight and bring to the prospective employee’s attention, that he or she will be an at-will employment.</p>\r\n<p>EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK – Having a current, legally compliant employee handbook is a must. A good handbook contains the “rules of engagement”-what the employer expects from its employees and what they can expect from it. Without a handbook, it is difficult to prove a given policy was in place and understood by your professionals and staff members.</p>\r\n<p>INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS – Uncertainty over whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor can pose substantial liability for employers. The money you save on the front end will never earn you enough interest to pay what you will owe on the back end. Oh, and you will pay.</p>\r\n<p>PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS – In a busy work environment, it is not at all uncommon for employee evaluations to fall by the wayside entirely. But employers that don’t conduct regular performance reviews may have difficulty terminating problem employees-especially when there’s a lack of notice regarding problems.</p>\r\n<p>EXIT INTERVIEWS – If an employer chooses to conduct exit interviews, they should be done every time someone leaves the business. These interviews can be used to help defend a lawsuit if a disgruntled employee decides to sue. For example, if a departing employee signs an exit interview summary indicating everything was fine, it will be difficult to later contend things were amiss.</p>\r\n<p>TERMINATION – A poorly administered employment termination with little or no documentation can present a serious problem for employers who later seek to show that the action was justified by legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons. Always document the reasons for termination</p>\r\n<p>Abiding by these rather straightforward suggestions will ensure that your business, from an HR perspective, operates efficiently, but also help minimize the possibility of legal claims from disgruntled employees.</p>\r\n', 'Some HR TIPS', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '85-revision-2', '', '', '2013-04-24 02:12:46', '2013-04-24 02:12:46', '', 85, 'http://anorgalaw.com/85-revision-2/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Julio’s Export and Import, Inc., Case Number: BC469855.  We conducted some investigation revealing that the plaintiff’s once tough exterior, was now to starting to demonstrate some cracks.  The client was pleased that we were able to obtain early resolution of this matter.</p>\r\n<p>In another matter, I was able to settle a dispute that looked like it was destined for a litigation.  My client, who has authorized this statement, delivered some widgets to a company for them to put a shrink-wrap on said widgets.  This company accepted the widgets, did the work, and returned the widgets to my client; however, a significant amount of the widgets were missing from the order.  My client alleged they were properly delivered, the other-side, obviously, alleged the opposite – so, Houston, we have a problem.  The facts of the matter strongly suggested that the company simply lost the widgets, or dropped the ball somehow, and they knew that but, of course, they could not admit to such a costly mistake.  Nevertheless, I was able to work out a deal where both parties were satisfied with the terms and, mostly, importantly, the business relationship between these two salvaged.</p>\r\n<p><em>Existing Matters</em> – Co-counsel and I are excited that our failure to pay commissions matter, which was being fought on two different fronts, will be consolidated and, ultimately, litigated in one courtroom up North, in Marin County.  This has been a great experience for me to work side-by-side with co-counsel, Clark Rivera – who is also my legal mentor.  He has a high-octane legal mind, and it’s been a beneficial learning experience for me, to be working on this matter.

(213, 2, '2011-11-08 18:22:13', '2011-11-09 01:22:13', 'I recently wrote an article for the Daily Journal entitled <em>Lost In Translation: non-English Fee Agreements</em>.  The article focused in on California Civil Code ¶ 1632(b)(6), which requires attorneys to translate their fee agreements (i.e., the contract between the attorney and client) if it was negotiated in either Spanish, Korean, Vietnamese, Tagalog, and Chinese.\n\nI understand that the article might have little interest if you’re not an attorney, or a potential client seeking to hire an attorney who speaks one of the languages mentioned above.  However, a closer examination of Civil Code ¶ 1632 reveals that the breadth of this law potentially affects a large part of our population.  Let me explain.\n\nSection 1632(b)(2) states that the law applies to a “loan or extension of credit secured other than by real property, or unsecured, for use primarily for personal, family or\n\nhousehold purposes.”  The likely application of this law significantly affects foreign speaking individuals seeking, among other things, a credit card or a car loan.\n\nIt is not uncommon to hear stories of Latino immigrants financing the purchase of a motor vehicle in Spanish only to sign a one-sided, inconspicous dealership agreement that is written in English.  Some unscrupulous dealerships prey on the unknowing by inserting terms in the English written agreement when there was no meeting of the minds as to these terms.  I am sure these types of illegal practices occur in the Korean, Chinese, Tagalog, and Vietnamese communities, too.\n\nSection 1632(b)(3) states that the law also applies to “a lease, sublease, rental contract or agreement, or other term of tenancy contract or agreement, for a period of longer than one month, covering a dwelling, an apartment, or mobilehome, or other dwelling unit normally occupied as a residence.”  This portion of the law has a tremendous affect on renters, landlords and real estate agents.  Let’s look at how this could play out in everyday life.\n\nYou, Korean speaking landlord, own an apartment building in Los Angeles County.  You negotiated a rental agreement for one of your units.  The renter and you did all the negotiating in Korean; however, you presented the renter with an English rental agreement.  In this scenario, you, landlord, should be happy, right? Wrong.  You have just violated the law, and given the renter an opportunity to rescind an agreement that was going to generate some honest to goodness rental income.\n\nThe remaining provisions of Civil Code ¶ 1632 protect against brokers facilitating reverse mortgage transaction, and conventional mortgages if they were negotiated in one of the languages mentioned herein.  Brokers, along with landlords, car dealerships, etc., should be careful to either provide the relevant documents central to the transaction in the translated language, or get around doing so by taking advantage of the exception set forth in Civil Code ¶ 1632(h), which provides, in pertinent part, that if the consumer/renter/legal client has his or her own translator over the age of 18, there is no requirement that the relevant documents be translated.\n\nAs you can see, Civil Code ¶ 1632 et seq., is a law, along with many others (Civil Code ¶ 2944.6 – translated loan modification documents), intended to protect foreign speaking consumers/renters/legal clients from entering into agreements that were not translated in the language that they were negotiated in.  However, it is completely short-sighted to think the law is a one-way street, and that it only protects consumers/renters/legal clients. No, it goes beyond to also protect business owners, landlords, attorneys, brokers, and financing companies from entering into agreements that can later be rescinded if they were not properly translated.\n\nSometimes certain written agreements have to be translated into specific languages.  If you or someone you know is seeking to enter into one of the transactions we have discussed, or someone who is seeking to get out of one of these transactions, please do not hesitate to call my office to discuss your legal options.', 'Sometimes, It Just Has to Be in Your Language.', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '78-revision', '', '', '2011-11-08 18:22:13', '2011-11-09 01:22:13', '', 78, 'http://anorgalaw.com/78-revision/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Anorga\n\nA bilingual or multilingual attorney can be a valuable resource to your law firm.  I have found that communicating with potential clients in their native Spanish language immediately promotes in them a sense of trust, comfort and confidence in my legal abilities.\n\nNot only do language skills enhance the attorney-client relationship, but it also allows the attorney to increase his or her market-share by carving out a legal niche with a certain language-speaking community.  Additionally, the globalizing economy is making it imperative for California attorneys to be able to communicate with individuals from all over the world, especially those in the Asian financial markets.  More locally, Spanish is by far the most widely spoken language in California, other than English.  Without a doubt, California attorneys are, indeed, leaving money on the table if they cannot communicate with potential clients in a language other than English.\n\nYou probably already knew or suspected that  state law requires certain fee agreements be translated from English into a different language. If you did, great – you are ahead of the curve.  If not, let’s briefly review the requirements of Civil Code Section1632 et seq. before you sign up that next well-healed foreign speaking client.\n\nCivil Code Section 1632 (b)(6) states that any attorney who negotiates legal services primarily in Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, or Korean, shall deliver to his or her potential client, a written translation of the fee agreement in the language in which it was negotiated prior to the execution thereof.  Say an exclusively Spanish speaking potential client walks through your door seeking legal representation.  During the client in-take, you and the potential client agree to the terms of the fee agreement.  You present the potential client with your tried and true English written fee agreement, which the client signs. Now your firm has a valuable new matter.  Under most circumstances, congratulations are in order; however, you have just violated Civil Code Section 1632, and potentially exposed yourself to a malpractice lawsuit affording the client the right to rescind the fee agreement.  Not good.\n\nI know what you are thinking, there has to be away around the requirements of Section 1632 (b)(6) so that you do not have to translate your reliable English fee agreement, right? And there is, but be careful of the scope of Civil Code Section 1632 (h), which provides an exception to the translation requirement if your client negotiates the terms of the fee agreement through his or her own interpreter, defined as a “person, not a minor, able to speak fluently and read with full understanding both the English language and any other languages in which the fee agreement was negotiated, and who is not employed” by you.  So, your assistant who is fluid in Chinese or Korean or any other of the covered languages will not be able to assist you with interpretation, and, thus, circumvent the translation requirement.\n\nIf the above-mentioned exception is not in play, your next move is to have your fee agreement translated into the language in which it was negotiated.  Here are a couple of tips to keep in mind:\n\nFirst, the most cost-effective way to translate a written fee agreement is by plugging into Google Translate, which is a free online resource that translates content in several other languages (except for Tagalog).  I recently cut and pasted my eight-page fee agreement into Google Translate, and I was astonished at how remarkably accurate Google translated my English fee agreement into Spanish.  There were minor issues with the translation, but I was able to rectify them without any problem.\n\nThere were some issues with Google Translate\'s word choices. For example, my English fee agreement collectively refers to me as an attorney; presumably, the common translation of that word should have been abogado. Google Translate, for some reason, used the word fiscal, which means district attorney or prosecutor.  This word choice problem is a likely specific to the Spanish language, which is the official language of 21 countries, each having their own nuanced dialect.\n\nGoogle Translate is probably best for those attorneys with a decent grasp of one of the covered languages under Civil Code Section 1632.  With some moderate editing, the attorney should be able to easily present the potential client with a properly worded and translated fee agreement.\n\nSecond, there is a thriving market dedicated to translating professional documents.  A simple online search for these types of services will bring up several different providers.  Legal document translation generally costs in between 14 to 26 cents per word, depending on the language.  Chinese and Spanish tend to be on the lower end of cost, while Korean and Vietnamese are middle of the road, and Tagalog being the most expensive.  Also, note that translating English into these languages can either expand or contract text.  Generally, all romantic languages, like Spanish, expand the text from an English translation.  This is also true for Vietnamese, but not necessarily so for Korean.  It varies with Chinese and Tagalog.\n\nWhen selecting a company to translate your fee agreement, determine whether it is an accepted member of the American Translators Association, which establishes a high standard of translating competency.  Also, make sure to determine if someone other than the translator will review your document for accuracy. Two sets of eyes are better than one.\n\nSo for all you talented linguistic attorneys seeking to build your practice with non-English speaking clients, or for those attorneys who already are, make sure to comply with the requirements of Civil Code Section 1632, et seq., and have your fee agreement translated into the language in which it was negotiated.  Because after you have obtained that favorable result for your client and its time for them to pay up, you do not want anything to suddenly get lost in translation.\n\nOmar S.

(216, 2, '2011-07-21 21:45:58', '2011-07-22 04:45:58', 'A California Court of Appeals judge once described the Small Claims Courts (limited to claims of $7,500.00 dollars or less) in our State, as a judicial forum yielding “speedy common sense justice without the need to resort to lawyers.” Indeed, the Small Claims Courts provide several benefits not generally offered by Courts of Limited (claims above $7,500.00 dollars but less than $25,000.00 dollars) and Unlimited (claims above $25,000.00 dollars) jurisdiction.\n\nThose benefits include, but are not limited to, the following:\n<ol>\n	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Quick Resolution</span>– Small Claims matters are generally resolved within two or three months from the date that the Plaintiff (individual initiating the lawsuit) files his or her complaint (document that sets forth the Plaintiff’s claims and request for relief, usually money). This is very different than the filing of a lawsuit in Limited or Unlimited Civil Jurisdiction, which, potentially, can go on for a year or two, sometimes even longer;</li>\n	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Affordable</span> – The cost for the filing of the complaint varies depending on the amount of your claim. Filing fees start at thirty dollars and cap out at seventy-five dollars.  Additionally, attorneys cannot represent litigating parties (Plaintiff or Defendant) in Small Claims court. So, a litigating party can get their day in court without the expense of retaining a lawyer and, thus, making the Small Claims forum even more affordable. Win-win.</li>\n	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Preservation of Judicial Resource</span>s– The courtrooms dealing with Limited and Unlimited Civil matters, especially, in Los Angeles County (the largest trial court system in the United States), are simply swamped with heavy caseloads. In addition, in 2010, the County laid off over three hundred court employees, and implemented a monthly furlough day for an entire year, causing even more delays in resolving these matters.  Simply put, more cases, less courtroom staff and time to handle these matters equals longer periods of time before outcome resolution. As such, Small Claims Courts play a critical role in alleviating Limited and Unlimited courtrooms of matters that can be handled by a judge in a speedy and fair manner.</li>\n</ol>\nAs you can see, the Small Claims Courts provide a tremendous public interest by providing us with an opportunity to resolve our grievances with little expense and delays. However, there are some perils in selecting the Small Claims judicial forum.  Chiefly among these dangers is the selection of the wrong forum.\n\nAs I mentioned above, Small Claims Courts can only handle matters in which litigating parties are seeking $7<ins datetime="2011-06-21T22:05" cite="mailto:raindeo">,</ins>500 dollars or less in damages.  What happens if your matter is worth more than this amount, but you, nevertheless, file in and are successful in obtaining a judgment in Small Claims Court?<ins datetime="2011-06-21T21:56" cite="mailto:raindeo"> </ins>\n\nRegretfully, you are more than likely limited to the amount of your judgment, which can be pretty painful as the example below will demonstrate.\n\nI recently heard of a situation in which a litigating party, who speaks only Spanish and who has no legal background or education, filed a matter in Small Claims Court.  She alleged that a contractor had breached a contract and performed less than workmanlike craftsmanship on her home.  She paid him approximately $80,000.00 dollars to perform the construction, which he did not complete.  She had independent evidence that the work performed was shoddy, below the proper construction standard, and that it would cost her over $100,000.00 dollars to get what she initially bargained for – an acceptable addition to her home.\n\nThe judge ruled in her favor, and entered into a judgment against the contractor in the amount of $7<ins datetime="2011-06-21T21:58" cite="mailto:raindeo">,</ins>500.00 dollars even though she would have more than likely obtained a much, much larger judgment if she would filed in a judicial forum with no limitations on damages.\n\nYou must be wondering why this lady is precluded from re-filing her matter in a different judicial forum for the purpose of obtaining larger damages?  The law in California, and in most states, has a legal concept akin to the old adage – you only get one bite at the proverbial apple.  This concept is called <em>Res Judacata</em>, and this Latin principal stands for preventing the same litigating parties from re-filing their same claims in subsequent litigation.\n\nIn the instant matter, this principal seems rather harsh and unsympathetic to the lady mentioned above; however, you can imagine what would happen if this law was not in place.  Indeed, litigating parties who lost their respective lawsuits, or who did not obtain the damages amount they wanted, would simply go to another court and re-file their lawsuits.\n\nThis ability to go shopping for different courtrooms until you found one that ruled the way you wanted is simply unacceptable, and would be an absolute nightmare for our court system, and the litigating party on the other end of the lawsuit.  He or she would never know if the problem central to the lawsuit would ever go away.  Lawsuits should have a beginning and an end, and <em>Res Judacata</em> make sure that they do.\n\nNext time you have a potential lawsuit, think twice about where is the best judicial forum to file it in.  Also, in some instances, you should consult with an attorney if you are unsure about where you should proceed with your lawsuit.  Remember, the Small Claims Courts can be the right place for you and your lawsuit, or it can be the absolute wrong place, too.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding this article, or questions regarding litigation counseling, please do not hesitate to contact the Law Offices of Omar S.

Persuade your neighbors to compromise whenever you can.  Point out to them how the nominal winner is often a real loser – in fees, expenses and waste of time.”</em> Abraham Lincoln. (Italicize added.)  If you can settle a matter early and without incident, do it.  If not, look at what you potentially could endure:\n\n•            Emotional Impact – Even the bickering in a minor dispute can be costly, because it distracts the participants from their primary occupation;\n\n•            Controversies Waste Time – A common feature of litigation the waste of time involved.  Constructive activities must be postponed.  Pleasures and profits are held in abeyance;\n\n•            The High Cost of Litigation – A judge once told me that litigation was only for well-heeled individuals.  Enough said.\n\n•            Your Reputation – Remember that your involvement in a lawsuit, which is a public document, can affect your reputation and your credit rating.  Even the rumor of a pending lawsuit can impair                 your business or future dealings with others.  Can you afford that risk?\n\n<em> Settlement During Litigation</em>\n\nEven the most reasonable and prudent individuals cannot avoid the filing of a lawsuit.  Indeed, sometimes parties, regretfully, feel that they can only receive a better result after the filing of a lawsuit.  Some attorneys call it leverage, and feel that the opposing party and/or their representative will not engage in meaningful settlement discussion until after the filing of a complaint.  This is a judgment call.  Nevertheless, once an individual has decided to boldly venture down the path of litigation, they have signaled to the other side that they are willing to let someone (i.e., a jury or a judge) else decide their fate.  Accordingly, a negotiated settlement after the filing of a lawsuit can benefit you in many ways:\n\n•            Compromise removes the risk of complete loss at trial;\n\n•            A settlement cuts off escalating litigation costs;\n\n•            The settlement process allows the parties to compromise their dispute on a rational basis, thus avoiding the risk that a judge or jury may decide their case with less understanding;\n\n•            A settlement removes the possibility of appeal;\n\n•            Pre-trial settlement removes the risk of witness problems at trial;\n\n•            A settlement can often be paid in installments;\n\n•            No exposure to punitive damages;\n\n•            A settlement precludes a reportable judgment, which is a permanent record; and\n\n•            A settlement eliminates the emotional strain of trial.\n\nIdeally, early settlement of a disagreement would more often than not be in your best interest; however, sometimes that is not possible or not desirable for some individuals.  But, at some point, even after the filing of a lawsuit, you should really consider your exposure in prosecuting or further defending a disagreement, and seriously consider whether or not you would benefit from settlement.  Honest Abe would probably think so.', 'Benefits of Settling a Disagreement ', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '180-revision', '', '', '2010-09-22 10:40:40', '2010-09-22 17:40:40', '', 180, 'http://anorgalaw.com/180-revision/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(225, 2, '2010-06-07 17:21:01', '2010-06-08 00:21:01', 'Today we will be talking California corporations and, specifically, closely held corporations and important documents like a voting agreement, shareholder agreement, and buy-sell agreement.  These documents are critical to shareholders and their involvement with closely held corporations, sometimes referred to as S Corps.  This blog entry will not discuss a corporation\'s by-laws.  You should contact an attorney for more information on by-laws.\n\nVOTING AGREEMENTS\n\nThe shareholders of a corporation may want to allocate control of the corporation in a way that is disproportionate to the ownership of shares of the corporation. Toward that end, they may want to ensure that their shares will be voted in a certain way. For example, they may want to vote their shares for specified persons as directors, vote as a majority of shareholders in the group may decide, or vote to effect a particular corporate policy. Common devices to accomplish these purposes are (1) voting agreements (or pooling agreements), in which the shareholders agree to vote their shares as provided in a voting agreement, and (2) voting trusts, in which legal title to the shares is transferred to a trustee, to be voted as provided in a trust agreement.\n\n<strong> </strong>\n\n<strong> </strong>Voting agreements may be used in a close corporation to permit the shareholders to control the management of the corporation. Several management alternatives to voting agreements and voting trusts exist. These include a close corporation shareholder agreement; or a provision in the corporation’s articles of incorporation for super-majority votes by the corporation’s directors or shareholders on various matters.  In addition, a corporation’s capital structure can be designed to give some shareholders control that is disproportionate to their dollar investment, either by providing for voting and nonvoting shares or shares with special voting rights. This result can also be obtained by issuing debt securities for a portion of the corporation’s initial financing, instead of issuing voting shares for that financing.  A group of majority shareholders in a close corporation can also use a holding company, instead of a shareholder’s voting agreement or voting trust, to consolidate their voting power. Further, shareholders may sometimes find it useful to create a partnership to hold their shares, or, on rare occasions, to cause the corporation to issue stock to several persons to be held jointly.\n\nA voting agreement differs from a shareholder agreement in three significant respects. First, the use of a voting agreement is not limited to shareholders of a close corporation, as is a shareholder agreement.  Second, a voting agreement may be among less than all of the shareholders. Third, a voting agreement covers only the exercise of shareholder voting rights and does not change the role of the shareholders with respect to the directors. Thus, if the shareholders of a close corporation want to enter into an agreement that extends beyond how their shares will be voted, and controls functions that are traditionally within the realm of the directors (for example, appointing officers and setting corporate policies), a shareholder agreement, not a voting agreement, should be used.\n\nSHAREHOLDER AGREEMENTS\n\nA shareholder agreement is a written agreement among all of the shareholders of a statutory close corporation [<em>see </em>Corp. Code § 158 (“close corporation” requires provision in articles limiting shareholders to 35 and specifically identifying corporation as a close corporation)] relating to the affairs and management of the corporation.  If the close corporation has only one shareholder, the shareholder agreement is between the shareholder and the corporation.\n\nThe General Corporation Law [Corp. Code § 300(b)] provides that no shareholder agreement that relates to any phase of the corporation’s affairs will be invalid as between the parties to it on any of the following grounds:\n\n•            It relates to the conduct of the affairs of the corporation so as to interfere with the discretion of the directors;\n\n•            It is an attempt to treat the corporation as if it were a partnership; or\n\n•            It is an attempt to arrange relationships among the shareholders in a manner that would be appropriate only between partners.\n\nThus, in practice, a shareholder agreement permits shareholders to do the following:\n\n•            Manage the close corporation informally, according to the provisions of the agreement, without observing corporate formalities related to director and shareholder meetings; and\n\n•            Make decisions in areas usually reserved for the board of directors, such as dividend policy, distribution of assets on liquidation, selection of officers, and determination of their compensation and tenure\n\nUnless otherwise provided in the shareholder agreement, the agreement may not be modified, extended, or revoked by less than unanimous agreement of the parties. A shareholder agreement terminates when the corporation ceases to be a close corporation, or on the original issuance of shares by the Corporation to a new shareholder who does not become a party to the agreement, unless the agreement provides that it will continue to the extent it is enforceable apart from Corp. Code § 300(b).\n\nShareholders in close corporations frequently want to manage the corporation in a partnership-like manner, determining among themselves who will manage the corporation’s business and how that management will be exercised, while retaining the limitation on personal liability and the other benefits of the corporation form. An important objective in many shareholder agreements is to protect a minority shareholder from the majority’s power by giving the minority shareholder a voice in the corporation’s management, either as a member of the board of directors or otherwise. Other shareholder agreements protect shareholder-employees by ensuring continued employment, and protect shareholder-investors by assuring a specified return of capital through dividends. A shareholder agreement may provide a mechanism requiring the corporation to buy back a shareholder’s shares on the occurrence of certain events such as the shareholder’s death, disability or termination of employment. The price for the buy back can be determined by a formula set forth in the shareholder agreement.\n\nBUY-SELL AGREEMENTS\n\nA buy-sell agreement (also known as a buyout agreement) is a contract, particularly important in the case of a close or closely held corporation, under which the shareholders or owners of a business agree to purchase the interests of a withdrawing or deceased shareholder [Black’s Law Dictionary (5<sup>th</sup> ed. 1979). At 181]. The agreement describes the conditions (usually death, disability, or termination of employment) and the terms under which shareholders may or must transfer their shares [Black’s Law Dictionary (5<sup>th</sup> ed. 1979, at 181].\n\nA buy-sell agreement is merely an executory contract to buy and sell personal property (that is, an employee’s shares) if and when a particular event such as termination of employment occurs. A shareholder under such an executory contract is entitled to the benefits of ownership until delivery is made or tendered to the buyer, unless the buy-sell agreement specifies or implies a different intention.\n\nGenerally, a buy-sell agreement provides the corporation and the shareholders with the certainty of a legally binding transfer plan well in advance of the actual events, facilitating agreement on the terms and manner of transfer. It ensures the uninterrupted continuation of the business entity in the event of the death or withdrawal of a participant, prevents “outsiders” from becoming transferees of corporate shares upon a shareholder’s death, disability, or retirement from the corporation, and enables the shareholders to sell their shares for a fair price despite the lack of a public market.  Further, if the agreement is properly shareholder’s interest in the corporation, and ensures that his or her estate will receive the liquid assets it may need for taxes, creditor’s claims, or probate expenses. An agreement may also give the remaining shareholders an option to dissolve the corporation upon the death of a major shareholder.\n\nI hope this was a good summary of important shareholder documents for California corporations.

It is important that if you are going to partner up with someone, the terms and conditions of your partnership relationship are set forth in a written partnership agreement.  A written document promotes clarity and puts partners on notice regarding acceptable partnership conduct.\n\nThe California Corporations Code §§ 16100, 1602 et seq., ("Act") provides rules to determine whether a partnership exists.  If a partnership does exist, it will be governed by both the partnership agreement and the Act.  Under the Act, the partnership agreement is defined as the agreement, whether written, oral, or implied, among partners concerning the partnership, including amendments to the partnership agreement.  The relations among the partners and between the partners and the partnership are governed  by this agreement, whether oral or written.  In addition, the Act will govern the relations among the partners and between the partners and the partnership, to the extent the partnership agreement does not provide otherwise.\n\nWhile the partnership agreement may vary most provisions of the Act, it may not do any of the following (non-exhaustive list):\n\n• Vary the rights and duties under the Corp. Code § 16105 regarding the statement of partnership, except to eliminate the duty to provide copies of statements to all of the partners.\n\n• Unreasonably restrict the right of access to books and records granted by Corp Code § 16403(b) or the right to be furnished with information concerning the partnership\'s business and affairs as granted by Corp Code § 16403(c)\n\n• Eliminate the duty of loyalty under Corp Code §§ 16404(b) and 16603(3), although, if it is not manifestly unreasonable, the partnership agreement may identify types or categories of activities that do not violate the duty of loyalty, and may provide that all of the partners or a specified percentage may authorize or ratify, after full disclosure of all materials facts, a specific act or transaction that otherwise would violate the duty of loyalty.\n\n• Unreasonably reduce the duty of care under corporation code.\n\n• Eliminate the obligation of good faith and fair dealing under the corporation code, but the partnership agreement may prescribe the standards by which the performance of the obligation is to be measured, if the standards are not manifestly unreasonable.\n\nA well-drafted partnership agreement will enable the partners to clarify their respective rights and obligations before the commencement of the partnership business.  This may eliminate ambiguities and areas of doubt that might result in future disputes and controversies.  The existence of an oral joint venture or partnership agreement must be established  by a preponderance of evidence.  Thus, where the agreement is not in writing, the intention of the parties must be determined from their language and conduct, and <em>misunderstandings may escalate into litigation</em>.\n\nAs with all other contracts, competency of the parties, consideration, the nature of the agreement, and a meeting of the minds are elements necessary of the validity of a partnership agreement.  A partnership agreement must be free from fraud.  Where a party has been induced to enter into a partnership by the fraudulent representations of a copartner, the agreement may be rescinded.  Similarly, the agreement must not have as its object an illegal purpose or be contrary to public policy if it is to be enforced.\n\nA partnership being drafted with respect to a specific enterprise should include provisions reflecting the type of business engaged in and the particular circumstances that may be unique  to that partnership.\n\nThat\'s all for now on partnership written agreements.  Stay tuned until next week when we will discuss certain types of partnerships - general, limited, etc.\n<p style="margin-left: -150px; padding-left: 151px; padding-right: 151px; font-size: 14px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.25em;">For more information on the matter, please contact the Law Offices of Omar S.

Instead, the harm done is to intangible assets, such as economic interests or business relationships.\n\n<strong>Fraudulent Misrepresentation</strong>\n\nFraudulent misrepresentation, known also as fraud or deceit, protects economic interests and the right to fair and honest treatment. For a fraud claim, a plaintiff must establish that the defendant intentionally misrepresented a material fact and the plaintiff relied on and was harmed by the misrepresentation. For example, if a business submits materially misleading financial statements to a bank in an attempt to secure a loan and the bank, relying on such statements, lends money to the business, the bank will have a fraud claim against the business if the business later defaults on the loan. A fraud claim may also arise from the failure to disclose a material fact if a defendant owed a duty to speak on account of a special relationship. For example, a financial advisor representing both a buyer and seller of real property may be liable for fraud if he knows that the property contains toxic chemicals and fails to tell this to the buyer.\n\n<strong>Interference with Contractual Relations</strong>\n\nThe tort of interference with contractual relations permits a plaintiff to recover damages based upon a claim that a defendant interfered with the plaintiff\'s contractual relations. The elements of an intentional interference with contractual relations claim are (1) a valid contract between plaintiff and a third party; (2) defendant\'s knowledge of this contract; (3) defendant\'s intentional acts designed to induce a breach or disruption of the contractual relationship; (4) actual breach or disruption of the contractual relationship; and (5) resulting damage.\n\nTo be considered tortious, a defendant\'s actions must substantially exceed fair competition and free expression, such as persuading a bank not to lend a competitor any more money.\n\n<strong>Interference with Prospective Business Advantage</strong>\n\nThe tort of interference with prospective business advantage protects economic interests that have not yet been formalized into contract. The elements of that tort are (1) an economic relationship between the plaintiff and some third person containing the probability of future economic benefit to the plaintiff, (2) defendant\'s knowledge of the existence of the relationship, (3) defendant\'s intentional acts designed to disrupt the relationship, (4) actual disruption of the relationship, and (5) damages to the plaintiff proximately caused by the acts of the defendant.\n\n<strong>Unfair Competition</strong>\n\nIn <a href="http://www.inc.com/topic/California">California</a>, the tort of unfair competition includes "any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising."
